<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>The following work is of Theological, Biographical,
and Bibliographical interest.</p>

<p>It has been written with the view of bringing a
class of Preachers before the public who are scarcely
known even by name to the theological student, but
who are certainly remarkable for their originality,
depth, and spirituality.</p>

<p>Among the numerous Preachers of the three centuries
under review, it has been difficult to decide which to
select, but those chosen are believed to be the most
characteristic.</p>

<p>The Author returns thanks to Mr. John Mozley Stark,
of Fitzwilliam-street, Strand, for his assistance in the
compilation of this Work, by the loan of some costly
and scarce volumes not in the Author’s library.</p>

<p>The title-page, and the Dance of Death at the head of
this page, are taken from the Sermons of Santius Porta,
printed and published by J. Cleyn, Lyons, 4to. 1513.</p>

<h2 id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>The history of preaching begins with the first sermon
ever delivered, the first and the best, that of our
blessed Lord on the mount in Galilee.</p>

<p>The declamations of the ancient prophets differ
widely in character from the sermons of Christian
orators, and in briefly tracing the history of sacred
elocution, we shall put them on one side.</p>

<p>For the true principles of preaching are enshrined in
that glorious mountain sermon. From it we learn what
a Christian oration ought to be. We see that it should
contain instruction in Gospel truths, illustrations from
natural objects, warnings, and moral exhortations, and
that considerable variety of matter may be introduced,
so long as the essential unity of the piece be not interfered
with.</p>

<p>In this consists the difference between Christ’s model
sermon, and the exhortations of those who went before
Him.</p>

<p>Jonah preached to the Ninevites, “Yet forty days, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Nineveh, shall be overthrown,” and that was his only
subject.</p>

<p>John Baptist preached in the wilderness, and on one
point only, “Prepare ye the way of the Lord.”</p>

<p>They confined themselves to a single topic, and that
purely subjective, whereas a Christian sermon is to be
both objective and subjective. It should be like Jacob’s
ladder, reaching from God’s throne to man’s earth, with
its subject-matter constantly ascending and descending,
leading men up to God, and showing God by His Incarnation
descending to man.</p>

<p>A Spanish bishop of the seventeenth century thus
speaks of the Sermon on the Mount, the model for all
sermons, and the pattern upon which many ancient
preachers framed their discourses.</p>

<p>He quotes St. John, “I saw in the right hand of Him
that sat on the throne a book written within and without,
sealed with seven seals;” and this book, he says, is
the life of our blessed Lord, written with the characters
of all virtues—within, in His most holy soul; without, in
His sacred body. It is sealed with seven seals. St.
John continues, “I saw a strong angel proclaiming with
a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to
loose the seals thereof? And no man in heaven, nor
in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the
book, neither to look thereon.”</p>

<p>Who, then, was worthy to open that book? None
save Christ Himself. He opened it in the Sermon on
the Mount, wherein He taught all men to follow and
observe the virtues which He practised Himself.</p>

<p>Hearken and consider as He opens each seal:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>“Blessed are the poor in spirit:” and behold Him at
the opening of this first seal, poor and of no reputation.</p>

<p>“Blessed are they that mourn:” and this second seal
displays Him offering up prayers for us, “with strong
crying and tears.”</p>

<p>“Blessed are the meek:” and we see Him meek and
lowly of heart, before the judgment-seat answering not
a word.</p>

<p>“Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness:”
this fourth seal exhibits Him whose meat it
was to do the will of Him that sent Him, and who on
the cross could still cry, “I thirst,” in the consuming
thirst for the salvation of our souls.</p>

<p>“Blessed are the merciful:” and “His mercy is over
all His works.”</p>

<p>“Blessed are the pure in heart:” and who was purer
than the Virgin Son of the Virgin Mother?</p>

<p>And the seventh seal opens with: “Blessed are the
peacemakers;” showing us Christ who made “peace by
the blood of His cross” between Jew and Gentile, between
God and man.</p>

<p>Every sermon preached since that mighty discourse,
which opened the life of Christ to man, what has it
been, but a turning over of leaf after leaf in that most
mysterious book?</p>

<p>There is something very striking in the accidents of
that first sermon, that fountain whence every rill of
sacred eloquence has flowed to water the whole earth;
delivered, not in the gloom of the temple, in the shadow
of the ponderous roof, like the burden of the law to
weigh it down, but in the open air, free and elastic like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
the Gospel, on a mountain-top, in the soft breeze beneath
an unclouded sun; the Preacher standing among
mountain flowers, meet emblems of the graces which
should spring up from His word, sown broadcast over
the world. We can picture the scene: the twelve around
Him, bowed in wonder, like the sheaves of the brethren
bending before the sheaf of Joseph; and beyond, a great
multitude with eager uplifted faces, a multitude hungering
and thirsting after righteousness, drawing in
the gracious words which proceeded from Christ’s lips;
whilst far below, gently ripples and brightly twinkles
the blue Galilean lake, over the waters of which that
Preacher walked, and the waves of which by one word
He stilled. We may say with the angel, “The waters
which thou sawest are peoples, and multitudes, and
nations, and tongues” (Rev. xvii. 15), and see in them
a type of the world once tossing in the darkness and
terror of a night of ignorance without God, but now to
be calmed in the daylight of His presence, and lulled
at the sound of His voice.</p>

<p>The following analysis of the Sermon on the Mount,
taken chiefly from Dr. J. Forbes, will give some idea of
its arrangement:—</p>

<div class="hanging">

<p class="center"><i>Introduction.</i></p>

<p>A. The character of the true members of Christ’s
kingdom diametrically opposed to the expectations
and character of the world.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The Beatitudes, or progressive stages of
Christian life (verses 3-10).</p>

<p>The reward of those who keep the beatitudes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
in this world (11) and in the next
(12).</p>

</div>

<p>B. The duty of Christ’s servants towards the world
(13-16).</p>

<p class="center"><i>The Subject.</i></p>

<p>“Christ is the end of the law for righteousness.”</p>

<p class="center">I.</p>

<p>(Ver. 17.) “Think not that I am come to destroy
the law and the prophets.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A. (Negative proposition) I am not come to
destroy,</p>

<p>B. (Positive proposition) but to fulfil.</p>

</div>

<p>Negative proposition explained (18, 19).</p>

<p>Positive proposition explained (20).</p>

<p>Christ then shows how that the law is made of none
effect by the Scribes and Pharisees, and not by
Himself.</p>

<p class="center">II.</p>

<p>A. The Teaching of Christ contrasted with
that of the Scribes. Perfect form of
the Second Table of the Law.</p>

<p>1. Law of Individual Life (VI Commandment, V
Beatitude) (21-26).</p>

<p>2. Law of Family Life (VII Commandment, VI
Beatitude) (27-32).</p>

<p>3. Central Law of Truth (IX Commandment)
(33-37).</p>

<p>4. Law of National Life (VIII Commandment):</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>On its Negative or Passive Side (III Beatitude)
(38-42).</p>

<p>On its Positive or Active Side (VII Beatitude)
(43-48).</p>

</div>

<p class="center">III.</p>

<p>The Practice required by Christ of His Disciples
contrasted with the Practice of the Scribes and
Pharisees.</p>

<p>First Defect of Pharisaical Righteousness, Ostentation,
or Hypocrisy. God must be regarded in
all our <i>Acts</i> (chap. vi. 1).</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>α. In the Duties owed to our Neighbours
(2-4).</p>

<p>β. In the Duties owed to God (5-15).</p>

<p>γ. In the Duties owed to Ourselves (16-18).</p>

</div>

<p>Second Defect of Pharisaical Righteousness, Worldliness.
God must be regarded in all our <i>Affections</i>
(19-34).</p>

<p>Third Defect of Pharisaical Righteousness, Spiritual
Pride. God must be regarded in all our <i>Judgments</i>
(chap. vii. 1, 2).</p>

<p>We must acquire Discernment to judge,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>a.</i> How to give (3-5).</p>

<p><i>b.</i> To whom to give (6).</p>

<p><i>c.</i> What to give (7-12).</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class="center"><i>Conclusion.</i></p>

<p>The conclusion sums up, in three practical exhortations,
the whole sermon. Such being the spirit of the
Law and the Prophets, and the strictness of the righteousness
required,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I. Beware of Supineness (13, 14).</p>

<p>II. Beware of false Teachers (15-20).</p>

<p>III. Beware of empty Professions (21-27).</p>

</div>

<p>The other sermons given in Holy Scripture are those
of St. Peter, St. Stephen, and St. Paul; in all of which
arrangement is discernible.</p>

<p>But passing from the apostolic age to those succeeding
it, we find that preaching consisted chiefly in
scriptural exposition, the only order observed being
that of the sacred text. Such was the nature of the
sermons of St. Pantænus (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 180), the Sicilian Bee,
so named from the way in which he gathered honey
from the flowers of prophetic and apostolic fields. He
is said to have travelled preaching the Gospel as far
as India, whence he brought back a Hebrew copy
of St. Matthew’s Gospel, left by St. Bartholomew.
St. Clement of Alexandria and Origen succeeded him;
adding polish and refinement to the matter. These
great men, so well versed in the history of the Old and
New Testaments, were also probably masters of the art
of preaching, though but few of their genuine homilies
are extant by which we might judge.</p>

<p>In Africa, St. Cyprian preached with eloquence and
vigour. A few sermons and homilies of St. Athanasius
remain; and fifty sermons preached by the Macarii to
the monks in the Thebaid. St. Ephraem Syrus, Deacon
of Edessa, was a voluminous writer, and an eloquent
preacher. Sozomen observes of him, that, though he
had never studied, yet he had so many beauties in his
style, and so many sublime thoughts, that the traces
of his eloquence are discernible through a translation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
St. Gregory Nyssen says that he had read and meditated
more than any one else on the Bible; that he
had written expositions upon all Holy Scripture; and
that he had, besides, composed many fervid and touching
exhortations. “All his discourses,” says he, “are
filled with weeping and compassionate expressions,
which are calculated to move even the hardest hearts.
For who that is proud would not become the humblest
of men, on reading his sermon on Humility? Who
would not be inflamed with Divine fire, by reading
his treatise on Charity? Who would not wish to be
pure in heart, when reading the praises he has lavished
on virginity? Who would not be alarmed on hearing
his discourse on the Last Judgment; wherein he has
described it so vividly, that not a touch can be added
by way of improvement? God gave him so profound
a wisdom, that, though he had a wonderful facility of
speaking, yet he could not always find words to express
the crowd of ideas which flowed into his mind.”</p>

<p>Every one knows what was the success of the homilies
of St. Augustine, of the two Gregories, of St. Chrysostom,
St. Basil, St. Ambrose. “There were giants in
those days.” We will not speak of them now, as their
lives and their works are well known. Suffice it to
say, that they spoke so as to suit the capacities of their
hearers. Sometimes they preached without preparation,
and in a homely manner; seeking rather to instruct
than to please.</p>

<p>St. Cyprian, St. Ambrose, and St. Leo, among the
Latins, pass with justice for the most eloquent orators
of their time. St. Augustine is more simple than they;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
but he preached in the small town of Hippo, to shopkeepers
and labourers.</p>

<p>In the age after Augustine, perhaps the most famous
preacher was Salvian (390-484), surnamed the Master
of Bishops, not that he ever was a Bishop himself, but
because so many of his pupils at Lerins became eventually
prelates in Gaul. Among the most eminent of
these was St. Cæsarius of Arles (470-542), son of the
Count of Chalons. He passed his youth in the shadow
of the cloister of Lerins, and left it only to succeed the
first fathers of that peaceful isle, Honoratus and Hilary,
upon the archiepiscopal throne of Arles. He was for
half a century the most illustrious and most influential
of the Bishops of Southern Gaul. He presided
over four Councils, and directed the great controversies
of his time. He was passionately beloved by his flock,
whose hearts he swayed with his fervid eloquence, of
which 130 still extant sermons bear the indelible stamp.
Another of the early preachers of Gaul was St. Eucher
(434), whom Bossuet calls “the Great;” and he, too,
issued from that great nursery of saints, the Isle of Lerins.</p>

<p>Valerian of Cemele (450), has left behind him sermons
plain and sound, but devoid of eloquence. Basil of
Seleucia was a preacher of fame in the East. Photius
says, that “his discourse is figurative and lofty. He
observes, as much as any man, an even tone. He has
united clearness with agreeableness, but his tropes and
figures are very troublesome. By these he wearies his
hearer always, and creates in him a bad opinion of himself,
as an ignorant person, incapable of blending art
with nature, and powerless to keep from excess.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Photius is rather too hard on Basil, whose sermons are
really stirring and good. The discourses of Andrew of
Crete (740) are also excellent; those of John Damascene
are poor.</p>

<p>Turning to England, we shall find Bede instructing
our Anglo-Saxon forefathers in the faith of Christ and
in the mysteries of the Gospel; and Alfric, in 990, compiling
homilies in the vulgar tongue, to the number of
eighty, and, among others, that famous one on the
doctrine of the Holy Eucharist, which Matthew Parker
could flourish in the face of his Romish opponents,
saying, “What now is become of your boasted argument
of apostolic tradition? see here that the novelties
with which you charge us are older than the doctrines
which you oppose to them!”</p>

<p>Wulfstan, Archbishop of York (1003), is known
through one remarkable sermon, “Sermo Lupi ad Anglos
quando Dani maxime persecuti sunt eos.”</p>

<p>We have now arrived at the true middle ages, and I
will say but little of the history of preaching in that
period, as it has already been treated of by that distinguished
ecclesiastical scholar, Dr. Neale, in his volume
“Mediæval Sermons.” And, indeed, but for his labours,
the bulk of this introduction would necessarily have
been extended beyond its due limits, for the middle ages
teemed with preachers, and preachers very striking for
their originality and depth. The monasteries were
great nurseries of preachers, sending forth continually
multitudes of carefully trained and orthodox teachers.
These preaching monks and friars exercised an immense
influence over the uneducated laity, and for long they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
worked in harmony with the secular clergy. Let me
give one instance from a chronicler of the thirteenth
century, Jacques de Vitry, who has left us some interesting
details concerning a very celebrated preacher of his
time, Foulque de Neuilly. “He excited to such an
extent all people, not only of the lower orders, but
kings and princes as well, by his few and simple words,
that none dare oppose him. People rushed in crowds
from distant countries to hear him, and to see the
miracles wrought by God through him.… Those
who were able to tear and preserve the smallest
fragment of his dress, esteemed themselves happy.
Besides, as his clothes were in great request, and as the
multitude were constantly tearing them off him, he was
obliged to have a new cassock nearly every day. And
as the mob commonly pressed upon him in an intolerable
manner, he struck the most troublesome with a stick
he held, and drove them back, or he would have been
suffocated by the throng eager to touch him. And,
although he sometimes wounded those whom he struck,
yet they were by no means offended, and did not murmur,
but, in the excess of their devotion, and the
strength of their faith, kissed their own blood, as
though it had been sanctified by the man of God.</p>

<p>“One day, as a man was engaged in ripping his
cassock with considerable violence, he spoke to the
crowd thus, ‘Do not rend my garments, which have
never been blessed: see! I will give my benediction to
the clothes of this man.’ Then he made the sign of
the cross, and at once the people tore to rags the man’s
dress, so that each obtained a shred.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Pass we now to the wane of sacred eloquence at the
close of the fourteenth century. By this time pulpit
oratory had become sadly debased, though still a few
noble orators, as Savonarola at Florence, Louis of
Granada in Spain, and Philip of Narni at Rome, shone
as lights.</p>

<p>In the place of earnestness came affectation: the
natural movement of the body, when the feelings of
the preacher are roused, was replaced by studied gestures;
the object of the orator was rather the exhibition
of his own learning than the edification of his hearers,
and the lack of matter in sermons was supplied by profanity
and buffoonery. Preachers became the slaves of
rule, their sermons were stretched on the same Procrustean
bed, and were clipped or distorted to fit the
required shape. By this means all natural eloquence
was stifled; every action of the body, every modulation
of the voice, was according to canon; and to such an
extent did this run, that some preachers made it a matter
of rule to cough at fixed intervals, believing that they
were thereby adding grace to their declamation. In
some old MS. sermons, marginal notes to the following
effect may be found: “Sit down—stand up—mop yourself—ahem!
ahem!—now shriek like a devil.”</p>

<p>Such is a sermon preached by Oliver Maillard, and
printed with these marginal notes at Bruges in 1500,
black letter, quarto. Balzac describes a lesson given by
an aged doctor to a young bachelor on the art of
preaching, and it consisted of this—“Bang the pulpit;
look at the crucifix with rolling eyes; say nothing to
the purpose,—and you <i>will</i> be a great preacher.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Throughout the fourteenth century sermons were
for the most part hammered out on the same miserable
block. The same text perhaps served for an Advent or
a Lenten series. Maillard in the next century preached
sixty-eight sermons on the text, “Come up … unto the
mount” (Exod. xxxiv. 2); and he took for his text
throughout Advent, Christmas, and the festivals immediately
following—in all forty-four sermons—the words
of St. James i. 21, “Wherefore lay apart all filthiness
and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness
the engrafted word, which is able to save your
souls.”</p>

<p>The preacher having given out his text, pronounced
a long exordium, in no way to the purpose, containing
some scriptural allegory, some supposed fact from
natural history, or a story extracted from a classic
historian. He then returned to his text and began to
discuss two questions, one in theology, the other in civil
or canon law, remotely connected with it. On the
theological question he quoted the sentiments of the
schoolmen, on the other he cited legal authorities.</p>

<p>He then proceeded to divide his subject under heads,
each of which was again subdivided, and each subdivision
was supported by the authority of a classic
philosopher, and illustrated by an anecdote often pointless,
sometimes indecent. Indeed, to such an extent
were classic allusions and quotations in vogue, that
the story is told of a peasant who had “sat under” his
priest for long, and had heard much of Apollo in the
Sunday discourses, bequeathing his old cart-horse “to
M. Pollo, of whom the curé had said such fine things.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>This absurd affectation continued long the bane of
the pulpit. In the sixteenth century a monk preaching
on the feast of St. Peter, saw no impropriety in
mingling mythology with Gospel history, and in
quoting the fable of Daphne to illustrate the denial
of the Apostle. “The nymph of the wood,” said he,
“being pursued by the shepherd Apollo, fled over hill
and dale, till she reached the foot of a rock up which
she could not climb, and, seeing herself at the mercy
of her pursuer, she began to weep,—in like manner,
St. Peter seeing himself arrested by the rock of his
denial, ‘wept bitterly.’” And Camus, Bishop of
Belley, who flourished in the beginning of the seventeenth
century, could use such words as these on
Christmas Day:—“We now, skimming over the sea
in our boat, come to behold the Infant born into the
world to conquer it. He is our Bellerophon, who,
mounted on the Pegasus of His humanity, winged by
union with the Deity, has overcome the world, ‘confidite,
ego vici mundum;’ the world, a true and strange
Chimera! lion as to its front by its pride, dragon
behind in its avarice, goat in the midst by its pollution!
He is our youthful Horatius overcoming the three
Curiatii of ambition, avarice, and sensuality! He is
our Hercules, who has beaten down the triple-throated
Cerberus, and who has in His cradle strangled serpents.
The one crushed only two, but ours has destroyed three,
the vanity of the world by His subjection, the avarice
of the world by His poverty, the delights of the world
by His mortification.”</p>

<p>Sometimes preachers, carried away by their feelings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
gave vent to the most violent and indecorous expressions.
As, for instance, the Père Guerin preaching
on the danger of reading improper literature, could not
refrain from using the following language with reference
to Theophilus Viaud, who had written a very
immoral poem, “La Parnasse des Poètes,” 1625, for
which he and his book were condemned to be burned.
“Cursed be the spirit which dictated such thoughts,”
howled the preacher. “Cursed be the hand which
wrote them! Woe to the publisher who had them
printed! Woe to those who have read them! Woe to
those who have ever made the author’s acquaintance!
But blessed be Monsieur le premier Président, blessed
be M. le Procureur Général, who have purged our
Paris of this plague! You are the originator of the
plague in this city; I would say, after the Rev. Father
Garasse, that you are a scoundrel, a great calf! but no!
shall I call you a calf? Veal is good when boiled,
veal is good when roast, calfskin is good for binding
books; but yours, miscreant! is only fit to be well
grilled, and that it will be, to-morrow. You have
raised the laugh at monks, and now the monks will
laugh at you.”</p>

<p>Preachers have been quite unable at times to resist
the chance of saying a bon mot. Father André, being
required to give out before his sermon that a collection
would be made for the dower of a young lady who
wished to take the veil, said—“Gentlemen, your alms
are solicited in behalf of a young lady who is not rich
enough to take the vow of poverty.” I believe it is
of the same man that the story is told, that he halted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
suddenly in the midst of a sermon to rebuke the congregation
for indulging in conversation whilst he was
speaking. One good woman took this in dudgeon, and
standing up, assured the preacher that the buzz of
voices came from the men’s side of the church, and not
from that reserved for the females. “I am delighted
to hear it,” replied the preacher, “the talking will
then be sooner over.” This reminds me of Gabriel
Barlette’s dictum, “Pone quatuor mulieres ab unâ
parte, decem viros ab aliâ, plus garrulabunt mulieres.”</p>

<p>Kings even have been publicly rebuked for something
of the same kind. Every one knows that Mademoiselle
d’Entragues, Marchioness of Verneuil, was
mistress of Henry IV. One day that the Jesuit father,
Gonthier, was preaching at St. Gervais, the king
attended with Mademoiselle d’Entragues, and a suite
of court ladies. During the sermon the marchioness
whispered and made signs to the king, trying to make
him laugh. The preacher, indignant at this conduct,
turned to Henry and said, “Sire, never again permit
yourself to come to hear the word of God surrounded
by a seraglio, and thus to offer so great a scandal in a
holy place.” The marchioness was furious, and endeavoured
to obtain the punishment of the preacher,
but Henry, instead of consenting, had the good sense
to show that he was not offended, by returning to hear
Father Gonthier preach on the following day. He
took him aside however, and said, “My father, fear
nothing. I thank you for your reproof; only, for
Heaven’s sake, don’t give it in public again.”</p>

<p>I have said that the preachers of the fifteenth century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
often degenerated into the burlesque, in order to
attract the attention they failed to rivet by the excellence
of their matter. Unfortunately this fault was not confined
to the fifteenth century, but we find it again and again
appearing among inferior preachers of the next two
centuries. It must be remembered that the monasteries
had then fallen from their high estate through the intolerable
oppression of the “in commendam,” and that
learning was far less cultivated than in an earlier age.
The popular friar-preachers, the hedge-priests, who took
with the vulgar, were much of the stamp of modern dissenting
ministers, men of little education but considerable
assurance; they spoke in the dialect of the people,
they understood their troubles, they knew their tastes;
and, at the same time, like all people who have got a
smattering of knowledge, they loved to display it, and
in displaying it consisted much of their grotesqueness.
The following sketch of one of these discourses is given
by Father Labat, in his “Voyages en Espagne et en
Italie, Amst., 1731, 8 vols. in 12mo.” He says that he
was present on the 15th September, 1709, at a sermon
preached in the open air under a clump of olives near
Tivoli.</p>

<p>The day was the Feast of the Name of Mary. “Those
who did the honours of the feast placed me, politely,
right in front of the preacher. He appeared, after
having kept us waiting sufficiently long, mounted the
pulpit, sat down without ceremony, examined his
audience in a grave and perhaps slightly contemptuous
manner; and then, after a few moments’ silence, he
rose, took off his cap, made the sign of the cross on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
brow, then on his mouth, and then on his heart, which
after the old system he supposed to be on his left side;
lastly, he made a fourth sign, which covered up all the
others, since it extended from his head to the pit of his
stomach. This operation complete, he sat down, put on
his cap, and began his discourse with these words, ‘I
beheld a great book written within and without,’ which
he explained thus: Ecco il verissimo ritrato di Maria
sempre Virgine; that is to say, Behold the veritable
portrait of the ever Virgin Mary. This application was
followed by a long digression upon all books ever known
in MS. or in print. Those which compose the Holy
Scriptures passed first in review; he named their
authors, he fixed their date, and gave the reasons for
their composition. He passed next to those of the
ancient philosophers, of the Egyptians and of the
Greeks; those of the Sibyls appeared next on the scene,
and the praise of the Tiburtine Sibyl was neatly interwoven
into the discourse. Homer’s Iliad was not forgotten,
any more than the Æneid; not a book escaped
him; and then he declared that none were equal to the
great book written within and without; a book, said he,
imprinted with the characters of divine virtues, bound
in Heaven, dedicated to wisdom uncreate<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, approved by
the doctors of the nine angelic hierarchies, published by
the twelve Apostles in the four quarters of the globe;
a book occupying the first place in the celestial library,
in which angels and saints study ever, which is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
terror of demons, the joy of heaven, the delights of
saints, the recompense of the triumphant Church, the
hope of the suffering, the support, the strength, the
buckler of the militant. He never left this great book,
the leaves of which he kept turning, so to speak, for
three good quarters of an hour, and then finding that it
was time to rest, he quitted us suddenly without a ‘good-bye.’
I mean without the blessing, and without having
spoken of the Blessed Virgin in any other light
than that which served him in the explanation of his
text.</p>

<p>“I confess I never heard a sermon which pleased me
better, for I was not a bit wearied during it; and, in
his style, I suspect he was unequalled. The Passion of
Father Imbert, Superior of our mission at Guadaloupe,
his sermon on St. Jean de Dieu, that of Father Ange de
Rouen, a Capuchin, on a certain indulgence, had hitherto
appeared to me inimitable masterpieces; but I must
award the palm to that which I have just reported, and
to do the preacher justice, he surpassed the others mentioned
as the empyrean sky surpasses the lunar sky in
grandeur and elevation.”</p>

<p>I must speak here of a famous preacher of the
fifteenth century, to whom I cannot afford a separate
notice, and who is more offensively ridiculous than the
man spoken of by Labat; I mean Gabriel Barlette. I
do not give him other notice than this for two reasons;
the first, because there is reason to believe that the
sermons which pass under his name are spurious compositions,
as indeed is asserted by a cotemporary,
Leander Alberti, who says that they were the composition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
of a pretender who took the name of the great
preacher.</p>

<p>It is therefore not fair to judge of a really famous
man from works which may not be his. Another
reason why I have limited to a few lines my notice of
sermons which were undoubtedly popular, if we may
judge of the number of impressions they went through,
is that there is positively no good to be got from them;
they are full of the grossest absurdities and the most
profane buffoonery. I have given an account of some
three or four of this class of sermon, and I can afford
no more room to similar profanities.</p>

<p>Gabriel Barlette was a Dominican, and was born at
Barletta in the kingdom of Naples. He lived beyond
1481, for he speaks of the siege and capture of Otranto
by Mahomet II. as a thing of the past. In one of the
sermons attributed to him is the following passage on
the close of the temptations:—“After His victory over
Satan, the Blessed Virgin sends Him the dinner she
had prepared for herself, cabbage, soup, spinach, and
perhaps even sardines.”</p>

<p>In a sermon for Whitsun-Tuesday, he rebukes distractions
in prayer, and he illustrates them in this unseemly
way. He represents a priest engaged at his
morning devotions, saying, “Pater noster qui es in
cœlis—I say, lad, saddle the horse, I’m going to town
to-day!—sanctificatur nomen tuum,—Cath’rine, put the
pot on the fire!—fiat voluntas tua—Take care! the
cat’s at the cheese!—panem nostrum quotidianum—Mind
the white horse has his feed of oats.… Is this
praying?” No, Gabriel, nor is this preaching!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Another preacher of the same stamp was Menot.
Michael Menot was born in Paris; he was a Franciscan,
and died at an advanced age in 1518.</p>

<p>Take this specimen of his reasoning—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The dance is a circular way;</div>
<div class="verse">The way of the Devil is circular;</div>
<div class="verse">Therefore the dance is the Devil’s way.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And he proves his minor by the Scriptural passages
“circuivi terram,” “circuit quærens quem devoret,”
“in circuitu impii ambulant.” In his sermon for
Friday after Ash-Wednesday he thus expresses his
sense of the value of magistrates: “Justices are like the
cat which is put in charge of a cheese lest the mice
should eat it. But if the cat lay tooth to it, by one
bite he does more mischief than the mice could do in
twenty. Just in the same manner,” &amp;c. The following
is a specimen of his style, a sad jumble of Latin and
French. He is giving a graphic description of the
prodigal son wasting his goods. “Mittit ad quærendum
les drapiers, les grossiers, les marchands de soye, et se
fait accoutrer de pied en cap; il n’y avait rien à redire.
Quando vidit sibi pulchras caligas d’écarlate, bien
tirées, la belle chemise froncée sur le collet, le pourpoint
fringant de velours, la toque de Florence, les
cheveux peignés, et qu’il se sentit le damas voler sur le
dos, hæc secum dixit: Oportetne mihi aliquid? Or me
faut-il rien? Non, tu as toutes tes plumes; il est
temps de voler plus loin. Tu es nimis propè domum
patris tui, pro benè faciendo casum tuum. Pueri qui
semper dormierunt in atrio vel gremio matris suæ,
nunquam sciverunt aliquid, et nunquam erunt nisi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
asini et insulsi, et ne seront jamais que nices et béjaunes.
Bref qui ne fréquente pays nihil videt.”</p>

<p>Of course this sermon was not thus preached, but it
gives us an idea of Menot’s acquaintance with Latin,
and of his utter inability to render the slang which had
disfigured his vernacular by classic phrases.</p>

<p>But it must not be supposed that all preachers of the
fifteenth century were like these clerical jesters.</p>

<p>Gabriel Biel was grave and dignified, his sermons
remarkably simple in construction, and full of wisdom
and fervour. The same may be said of Thomas à
Kempis, John Turricremata, and Henry Harphius.</p>

<p>With the sixteenth century a new phase of pulpit
oratory was about to dawn. Men wearied of conventional
restraints, and spoke from the heart, knowledge
was profounder, less superficial, the conceits of
schoolmen were kept in the background, and scriptural
illustrations brought into greater prominence. Anecdote
was still used as a powerful engine for good, but it was
anecdote such as would edify. Similes were introduced
of the most striking and charming character; and the
preachers sought evidently rather to instruct their
hearers, and to render doctrine intelligible, than to
surround themselves with a cloud of abstruse doubts
and solutions, to the bewilderment of their hearers,
and to their own possible glorification. It is impossible
not to see in this a fruit of the Reformation.
To people famishing for the bread of life, the preachers
of the fifteenth century had given a stone, and now
their successors were alive to the fact, and strove
earnestly to remedy it. They threw themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
forward like Phineas, and stood in the gap, so that
it is to them, perhaps, more than to great theologians
like Bellarmin, that the Catholic Church must look
with thanks for having stayed the advancing tide of
reform.</p>

<p>If, in that age of religious upheaval, the pulpit had
remained as unedifying as heretofore, there can be no
manner of doubt that the eruption in Germany would
have devastated Italy, France, and Spain. Indeed the
Huguenot party in France was very powerful, and
extended so widely that it must be a matter of surprise
to many to find its tenets now represented by
a few miserable, quivering fragments. In fact the
Roman Church, after the first shock, recovered ground
on all sides, for her clergy rose to meet the emergency,
and turned to the people as the true source of strength
to the Church, and leaned on them, instead of putting
her trust in Princes. I cannot believe that the massacres
of the Huguenots had any thing to do with the
extirpation of Protestantism in France, for persecution
strengthens but never destroys. I am rather inclined
to attribute it to the vigour with which the clergy of
the time set themselves to work remedying the abuses
which had degraded pulpit oratory. Sacred eloquence
is the most powerful engine known for influencing
multitudes, and the Catholic clergy resolutely cultivated
it, and used it with as much success as Chrysostom,
Gregory, or Augustine. They had a vast
storehouse of learning and piety from which to draw,
the writings of the saints and doctors of the Church in
all ages, and they drew from it unostentatiously but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
effectively. Their sermons were telling in a way no
Protestant sermons could equal, for the Calvinist or
Lutheran had cast in his lot apart from the great
men of antiquity, whilst the Catholic could focus
their teaching upon his flock. The former had but
their own brains from which to draw, whilst the
latter had the great minds of Catholic antiquity to
rest upon. There are vast encyclopedias and dictionaries
of theology, moral and dogmatic, filled with matter any
Catholic preacher of the meanest abilities could work
up into profitable and even striking discourses, great
collections of anecdote and simile, which he might
turn to for illustrations, and, above all, exhaustive
commentaries on every line, aye, and every word of
Scripture.</p>

<p>From all these great helps to the preacher, the
Protestant minister conscientiously, and through prejudice,
kept aloof.</p>

<p>This may account for the undoubted fact that after
the first flush of triumph, sacred oratory in the reformed
communities sank to as dead and dreary a
level as it had attained in the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>The Protestant preachers were not always as grotesque,
but they became as dull and unspiritual, whilst the
Roman Church having once napped, never let herself
fall asleep again, but with that tact which once characterized
her, but which is fast leaving her, she stirred up
and kept alive ever after the fire of sacred eloquence.</p>

<p>And here I must make an extraordinary statement,
yet one indisputably true, however paradoxical it may
appear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>The main contrast between Roman Catholic sermons
and those of Protestant divines in the age of which I
am speaking, consists in the wondrous familiarity with
Scripture exhibited by the former, beside a scanty use
of it made by the latter. It is not that these Roman
preachers affect quoting texts, but they seem to think
and speak in the words of Scripture, without an effort;
Scriptural illustrations are at their fingers’ ends, and
these are not taken from one or two pet books, but
selected evenly from the whole Bible.</p>

<p>Let me take as an instance a passage selected at
hap-hazard from Königstein, an unknown German
preacher. He is preaching on the Gospel during
the Mass at dawn on Christmas Day. I choose him,
for he is as homely a preacher as there was in the sixteenth
century, and as he may be taken as a fair
representative of a class somewhat dull.</p>

<p>“‘And the Shepherds said one to another, Let us
now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which
is come to pass’ (Luke ii. 15). The Saviour being desirous
of weaning altogether the hearts of His own people
from worldly glory, not only chose to be born in poverty,
but to be announced <i>to</i> poor folk, and to be proclaimed
<i>by</i> them. And this He chose lest the beginning
of our faith should stand in human glory or wisdom,
<i>which is foolishness with God</i>, whereas He desired that it
should be ascribed to Divine grace only; therefore the
Apostle says, ‘<i>After the kindness and love of God our
Saviour towards man appeared</i>,’ &amp;c. <i>Kindness and love</i> in
His conversation, and His nativity into this world, by
taking our flesh; <i>of God our Saviour</i>, by His own vast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
clemency; <i>not by works of righteousness which we have
done</i>, for <i>we were by nature children of wrath</i>, so that our
works were not done in justice, nor could we gain
safety by them; but <i>according to His mercy He saved us</i>
by present grace and by future glory, as <i>we are saved by
Hope</i>; and it is <i>He who hath called us with an holy calling,
not according to our works, but according to His own
purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus
before the world began, by the washing of regeneration
and the renewal of the Holy Ghost</i>, that is, by the
washing of Baptism, which is a spiritual regeneration,
for, <i>except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he
cannot enter into the Kingdom of God</i>. Water cleanses
the body without, and the Spirit purges the soul within.
In Baptism man ends the old life which <i>was under the
law</i>, that he may begin the new life which is <i>under
grace</i>; so that he who believes is daily renewed more
and more <i>by the Spirit, which is given us</i> in Baptism;
as says the Apostle, <i>Be renewed in the spirit of your
mind</i>,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>Of a similar character are the sermons of Helmesius,
and the simple; earnest, and thoughtful postils of Polygranus.</p>

<p>There is another observation which I must make
upon these venerable preachers. It is impossible to
read them attentively without observing how different
in tone they are to modern ultramontane theologians,
and how sadly modern Romanism has drifted from
primitive traditions, and how rapid has been its descent,
when this is noticeable by ascending the stream
of time but a few centuries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>I am not prepared to say that there is nothing false
and unprimitive in the doctrine of these great preachers,
but that doctrinal corruption was not then fully developed.
I suppose that an English priest would find it hard to
select a sermon of the new Roman school, which he
could reproduce in his own pulpit; but if he were to
turn to these great men of a past age, he would meet
with few passages which he should feel himself constrained
to omit. The germ of evil had been slowly
expanding through the middle ages; it flowered at the
close, and now it has seeded, and become loathsome
in its corruption.</p>

<p>Let me take the worship of the Blessed Virgin,
which has of late assumed such terrible dimensions.
A modern Roman preacher rarely misses an opportunity
of inculcating devotion to Mary. But it was
not so with the old preachers. They do use language
which cannot always be justified, but, more often,
language which ought to be frankly accepted by us,
considering that the tone of English reverence is
unwarrantably low with regard to the blessed ever-virgin
Mother. Often when there is a natural opening
for some words of deification of Mary, the preachers
of the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries
turn from it to make a moral application to their
hearers. I will only instance De Barzia, a bishop of
Cadiz. He gives three sermons for the Purification.</p>

<p>The first is on the care which a Christian man
should take not to scandalize his neighbours by any
act which though innocent might give offence, or by
the neglect of any duty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>The second is on the great danger of setting an evil
example.</p>

<p>The third is on the funeral taper, by the light of
which those truths, which man saw not in the day
of his life, are then most evidently discerned.</p>

<p>For the Annunciation he gives three sermons. The
first on the modesty of Mary, which all should imitate.
The second is on the general confession of sin made in
Lent. The third is on the promptitude with which man
should act on Divine impulses.</p>

<p>It is true that De Barzia uses strong language from
which we should dissent, on the feasts of the Assumption
and the Nativity of Mary; but the fact of letting
two of her festivals pass without pointing her out as a
prominent object of worship is what, I should suppose,
no modern Ultramontane would do.</p>

<p>I must now turn to a bright and pleasant feature
in these preachers—their keen appreciation of the
beauty of nature. This indeed had been a distinguishing
characteristic of the Middle Ages. In architecture,
in painting, and in poetry, even in preaching, the great
book of nature had been studied, and its details reproduced.
As the sculptor delighted to represent in stone
beast, and bird, and plant; as the painter rejoiced to
transfer to canvas, with laborious minuteness, the tender
meadow flowers; so did the preacher pluck illustration
from the book of nature, or refer his hearers to it,
for examples of life.</p>

<p>With the Renaissance, the artist turned from the
contemplation of God’s handiwork, but not so the
sacred orator. In him the same love for the works<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
of God is manifest, his mind returns to them again
and again, he gathers simile and illustration from
them with readiness and freedom, he seems to stand
before his congregation with the written word in his
right hand, and the unwritten word in his left, and
to read from the written, and then turn to the unwritten
as the exponent of the other. Nature was
not then supposed to be antagonistic to Revelation,
but to be its Apocrypha, hidden writings full of the
wisdom of God, and meet “for examples of life and
instruction of manners.”</p>

<p>The great Bernard used the heart-language of every
mediæval theologian when he said, “Believe me who
have tried it; you will find more in the woods than
in books: the birds will teach you that which you
can learn from no master.”</p>

<p>In like temper did Philip von Hartung preach to
a courtly audience on the text, “Consider the fowls of
the air,” and drawing them away from the glitter of
the palace, and the din of the city, set them down
in a meadow to hear the lessons taught them by the
lark.</p>

<p>“Consider the fowls of the air, and look first to
the lark (<i>alauda</i>), drawing its very name, <i>a laude</i>,
out of praise; see how with quivering wing it mounts
aloft, and with what clear note it praises God! Aldrovandus
says that he had been taught from childhood,
that the lark mounted seven times a day to sing hymns
to its Creator, so that it sings ascending, and singing
soars.</p>

<p>“St. Francis was wont to call the larks his sisters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
rejoicing in their songs, which excited him to the
praise of his Creator. Seven times a day might we
too chant our praise to God: first for our creation,
which was completed in seven days; then for our
Redemption, which was perfected by the seventh
effusion of blood; thirdly, for the seven sacraments
instituted by Christ; fourthly, for the seven words
uttered from the Cross; fifthly, for the seven gifts
of the Spirit shed on us from on high; sixthly, for
our preservation from the seven deadly sins, even
though the just man falleth seven times a day (Prov.
xxiv.); and lastly, for the seven sad and seven glorious
mysteries of the Blessed Virgin Mary.</p>

<p>“A heavenly lark was royal David, going up to Thee,
O God, ‘seven times a day’ to praise Thee! David
from the softness of a palace; David from the cares
of a kingdom; David from the tumult of battle; David
engaged in so great correspondence with many and
mighty kings, seven times a day, rose to the praise
of God; and shall not you, my brethren, mount from
your ease seven times a day to give thanks unto God?
Threefold, aye! and fourfold, were our blessedness, if
from this vale of tears our hearts would but wing their
way on high to seek true and never-fleeting joys. Notice
the lark! it is not content, like the swallow, to skim
the surface of earth, but it must struggle up higher
and higher. ‘The higher the soul goes,’ says Hugo,
‘the more it rejoices in the Lord.’ And just as the lark
when on earth is hushed, but mounting breaks into joy
and song; so does the soul raised to Heaven rapturously
and sweetly warble. It sings not upon the topmost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
boughs of trees, as though spurning all that is rooted
in earth. And so do you cast away all cares, all
intercourse, all affairs of life, all that is evil, all, in
short, that is earthy. Socrates was wont to say that the
wings of a lark failed us when we came down from
Heaven, drawn by the host of earthly objects. But
we can spread them again to flee away and be at rest,
if we will, by earnest endeavour, dispose our hearts to
mount, and so go on from grace to grace.”</p>

<p>Beside this let me place a lesson from the flowers,
culled from Matthias Faber. “They teach us to trust
in God. I pray you look at Divine Providence exerted
in behalf of the smallest floweret. God has given it
perfect parts, and members proportioned to its trunk;
He has provided it with organs for the performance
of all those functions which are necessary to it, as the
drawing up of juice, and its dispersion through the various
parts; a root branching into tiny fibres riveting it to
the soil; a stalk erect, lest it should be stained and
corrupted through contact with the earth, strong also,
lest it should be broken by the storm, a rind thick or
furred to protect it from cold, or heat, or accident; twigs
and leaves for adornment and shelter; a most beauteous
array of flower above the array of Solomon in all his
glory. He has given it, besides, a scent pleasant to
beasts or men; He has endued it with healing properties,
and, above all, with the faculty of generating in its
own likeness. How many benefits conferred on one
flower! one flower, I say, which to-morrow is cut down
and cast into the oven! What, then, will He not give
to man, whom He has made in His own image, an heir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
of Heaven!… ‘Consider the lilies of the field how they
grow,’ aye! <i>how</i> they grow, how is it? They grow
steadily night and day, stretching themselves out and
expanding, so that no man may discern the process
going on. So, too, let us grow, daily extirpating
vices, daily implanting virtues, thus sensibly increasing,
so that, after the lapse of years, we may be found to
have advanced in spiritual growth, though we ourselves
may not have known it. As said the Apostle, ‘Forgetting
those things which are behind, and reaching forth
unto those things which are before, I press towards the
mark’ (Phil. iii. 13).</p>

<p>“They teach us, also, to sigh for heavenly beatitude,
and the society of the blessed. If even in this world
such variety of flowers is seen, such beauty, such
fragrance, and these in flowers which to-day are and
to-morrow are cast into the oven, what will be the
beauty, what the variety, what the glory of the elect in
the kingdom of God! Those who go to distant lands
are ever discovering fresh and fresh flowers; and so in
Heaven is there unmeasured variety among the angels
and the elect.</p>

<p>“Yet in all this variety there is perfect unity. For as
in the same garden, or meadow, the flowers are content
with their several beauties, and no one impedes the
growth of another, or thrusts it out of its place, but all
look up to the one sun, and bask and grow and gather
strength in his brightness; so also in Heaven. There
each of the Blessed will be content with his portion of
glory, none interfering with another, none envying
another. For all will see God face to face, and live<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and move and have their being in His presence, and
therewith be satisfied through eternity.”</p>

<p>Simile has been used extensively in all ages of the
Church, but in the fifteenth century it had become very
mean and coarse. Meffreth could talk of the world as
being untranquil, like a globule of quicksilver, never to
be brought to rest till fused to a black residuum in the
sulphurous blast of Hell; and could illustrate the text,
“Here we have no continuing city,” by comparing this
poor world of ours to the weed-covered back of a large
whale, which an eminent and veracious navigator—of
course he means Sinbad—mistook for a verdant isle,
only to discover his mistake when he began to drive
into it the stakes of his habitation.</p>

<p>Far nobler was the use of simile in the great revival
of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>Pre-eminent among those who made it a vehicle for
conveying truths, are the names of De Barzia and
Osorius; both men of great refinement of taste and
richness of imagination.</p>

<p>What, for example, could be more graceful than the
following, given by the Bishop of Cadiz, when speaking
of the impossibility of man comprehending the reason
of God’s dealings, when He touches with the finger of
death at one time a child, at another an aged man, then
a youth, and next, perhaps, one in full vigour of manhood?
To us, this selection seems to be a matter of
chance, but there is no chance in it. The Bishop then
uses this illustration. The deaf man watches the
harpist, and sees his fingers dance over the strings in a
strange and unaccountable way. Now a strong silver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
cord is touched, then a slender catgut string. At one
time a long string is set vibrating, at another a very
short string; now several are thrummed together, and
then one alone is set quivering. Just so is it with us;
we hear not the perfect harmony, nor follow the wondrous
melody of God’s operations, for the faculty of
comprehending them is deficient in us, and to us in our
faithlessness there seems chance and hazard, where
really there exists harmony and order.</p>

<p>Osorius uses a different simile in illustrating an idea
somewhat similar.</p>

<p>He is speaking to those who murmur at God’s dealings
in this world, and who would fain have His disposition
of things altered in various particulars. He then
says, that those who look on an unfinished piece of
tapestry see a foot here, a hand there, a patch of red in
one spot, of green in another, and all seems to be confusion.
Let us wait till the work is complete, and we
shall see that not a hand or foot, not a thread even is
out of place. Such is the history of the world. We
see blood and war where there should be peace; we see
men exalted to be kings who should have been slaves,
and men condemned to be slaves who would have ruled
nations in wisdom and equity, and we think that there
is imperfection in the work. Wait we awhile, till at
the Last Day the great tapestry of this world’s history
is unrolled before us, and then we shall see that all has
been ordered by God’s good providence for the very
best.</p>

<p>But Scripture supplied most of the illustrations needed
by these preachers. It was to them an inexhaustible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
storehouse, from which they could bring forth things
new and old. Holy Scripture seems to have supplied
them with every thing that they required; it gave them
a text, it afforded confirmation to their subject; from it
they drew mystical illustrations for its corroboration,
and examples wherewith to enforce precept.</p>

<p>To some, the sacred page may be crystalline and
colourless as a rain-drop, but to these men who knew
from what point to view it, it radiated any colour they
desired to catch.</p>

<p>They did not always make long extracts, in the
fashion of certain modern sermon-composers, who form
a sermon out of lengthy Scriptural passages clumsily
pegged together, always with wood; but with one
light sweep, the old preachers brush up a whole bright
string of sparkling Scriptural instances, in a manner
indicating their own intimate acquaintance with Scripture,
and implying a corresponding knowledge among
their hearers. Take the following sentence of an old
Flemish preacher as an instance: he is speaking of the
unity prevailing in heaven:—</p>

<p>“<i>There</i> all strife will have ceased, there all contradiction
will have ended, there all emulation will be
unknown.</p>

<p>“In that blessed country there will be no Cain to slay
his brother Abel; in that family, no Esau to hate
Jacob; in that house, no Ishmael to strive with Isaac;
in that kingdom, no Saul to persecute David; in that
college, no Judas to betray his master.”</p>

<p>Let me take another example from a sermon on the
small number of the elect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Many are called, but few are chosen.’</p>

<p>“Noah preached to the old world for a hundred
years the coming in of the flood, and how many were
saved when the world was destroyed? Eight souls, and
among them was the reprobate Ham. Many were called,
but only eight were chosen.</p>

<p>“When God would rain fire and brimstone on the
cities of the plain, were ten saved? No! only four,
and of these four, one looked back. Many were called,
but three were chosen.</p>

<p>“Six hundred thousand men, besides women and
children, went through the Red Sea, the like figure
whereunto Baptism doth even now save us. The host of
Pharaoh and the Egyptians went in after them, and
of them not one reached the further shore. And of
these Israelites who passed through the sea out of
Egypt, how many entered the promised land, the land
flowing with milk and honey? Two only—Caleb and
Joshua. Many—six hundred thousand—were called,
few, even two, were chosen. All the host of Pharaoh,
a shadow of those who despise and set at nought the
Red Sea of Christ’s blood, perish without exception;
of God’s chosen people, image of His Church, only few
indeed are saved.</p>

<p>“How many multitudes teemed in Jericho, and of
them how many escaped when Joshua encamped against
the city? The walls fell, men and women perished. One
house alone escaped, known by the scarlet thread, type of
the blood of Jesus, and that was the house of a harlot.</p>

<p>“Gideon went against the Midianites with thirty-two
thousand men. The host of Midian was without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
number, as the sand of the sea-side for multitude. How
many of these thirty-two thousand men did God suffer
Gideon to lead into victory? Three hundred only.
Many, even thirty-two thousand men, were called;
three hundred chosen.</p>

<p>“Type and figure this of the many enrolled into
the Church’s army, of whom so few go on to ‘fight
the good fight of faith!’</p>

<p>“Of the tribes of Israel twelve men only were chosen
to be Apostles; and of those twelve, one was a traitor,
one doubtful, one denied his Master, all forsook Him.</p>

<p>“How many rulers were there among the Jews
when Christ came; but one only went to Him, and he
by night!</p>

<p>“How many rich men were there when our blessed
Lord walked this earth; but one only ministered unto
Him, and he only in His burial!</p>

<p>“How many peasants were there in the country
when Christ went to die; but one only was deemed
worthy to bear His cross, and he bore it by constraint!</p>

<p>“How many thieves were there in Judæa when
Christ was there; but one only entered Paradise, and
he was converted in his last hour!</p>

<p>“How many centurions were there scattered over the
province; and one only saw and believed, and he by
cruelly piercing the Saviour’s side!</p>

<p>“How many harlots were there in that wicked and
adulterous generation; but one only washed His feet
with tears and wiped them with the hair of her head!
Truly, ‘Many are called, but few are chosen.’”</p>

<p>We hear but little in modern sermons of the mystical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
interpretation of Scripture, which was so common in all
earlier ages of the Church. The Epistles of St. Paul
show us that the primitive Church was accustomed to
read Scripture in a mystical way. What, for instance,
can be more “fanciful,” as we moderns should say, than
his allegorizing of the history of Isaac (Gal. iv. 22-31),
and of Moses (1 Cor. x. 1), or his argument from the
law that the laity should pay for the support of their
pastors: “For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou
shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out
the corn” (1 Cor. ix. 9, 10), and “Let the elders that
rule well be counted worthy of double honour (i.e. <i>honorarium</i>,
contribution in money) … <i>for</i> the Scripture
saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out
the corn?” (1 Tim. v. 17, 18.) Bacon said that we
should accept as conclusive the meaning of Scripture
which is most plainly on the surface, just as the first
crush of the grape is the purest wine, forgetting, as
Dr. Neale aptly remarks, that the first crush of the
grape is not wine at all, but a crude and unwholesome
liquor. Certainly modern preachers are ready enough
to give us the most superficial interpretation of Scripture,
and rarely trouble themselves with probing the
depths of Holy Writ for fresh lessons and new beauties.
In the same way it was quietly assumed till of late that
the ocean below that depth which is storm-tossed
was quite azoic. We know now that that untroubled
profound teems with varied forms of life, and is glorious
with hitherto undreamt-of beauties. Our modern
divines are content with the troubled sea of criticism,
and pay no heed, and give no thought, to the manifold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
beauties and wonders of the tranquil deeps of God’s
mind, above which they are content to toss. The
analogy between God’s word written and God’s unwritten
word is striking. Yet we are satisfied to know
that the further the great volume of Nature is explored,
the closer it is studied, the greater are the wonders
which it will display. Why, then, do we doubt that
the same holds good with the written word? Deep
answers to deep, the deep of Nature to the deep of
Revelation. The Same Who is the Author of Nature
is the Author of Revelation; and we may therefore
expect to find in one as in the other that “His
thoughts are very deep,” “His ways past finding out;”
that in one as in the other there is a similarity, a
mighty variety yet an essential unity, a vast diversity
yet a perfect harmony; that there are mysteries in
both, through which, as through a glass darkly, shines
the wisdom of the Creator.</p>

<p>Commentators on Scripture, such as Scott and Henry,
really fill pages and volumes with the most deplorable
twaddle, and exhibit conclusively their utter incapacity
for commentating on any single passage of Scripture.
Not only are their comprehensions too dull to grasp
the moral lessons in the least below the surface, but
they entirely ignore the mystical signification of the
events recorded in the Sacred Writings. To the Mediæval
divines and those who followed their steps, every
word of Scripture had its value; indeed, the very
number, singular or plural, of a substantive was with
them fraught with significance. Take one instance;
Stella the Franciscan remarks, on St. John xiv. 23:—“‘Jesus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
answered and said unto him, If a man love Me,
he will keep My <i>word</i> (τὸν λόγον μου τηρήσει): he that
loveth Me not, keepeth not My <i>words</i> (τοὺς λόγους μου
οὐ τηρεῖ).’ Love of God makes one command out of
many, for to him who loves, the many precepts are
but as one. So here Christ says, ‘If any man love Me,
he will keep My word;’ but of him who loves not, He
says, ‘He keepeth not My words.’ Of him who loves, it
is spoken in the singular; of him who loves not, in
the plural. Eve said, ‘Of the fruit of the tree which is
in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not
eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die’ (Gen. iii.
3); whereas God forbade only the eating, not the
touching. But a chilled heart made one command into
two; whilst a heart full of love, like that of David,
could sum up the six hundred and thirteen precepts of
the old law into one, when he exclaimed, ‘Thy commandment
is exceeding broad,’ and ‘Lord, what love
have I unto Thy law, all the day long is my study
in it.’”</p>

<p>Compare with this suggestive passage the only remark
made on the text in D’Oyly and Mant: “The
manifestation I mean is, that of inward light and
grace, which shall never depart from those who are
careful to live as I have commanded them.” The observation
of Stella is suggestive, that in D’Oyly and
Mant is decidedly the reverse.</p>

<p>But I would speak now of the mystical interpretations
of Scripture. I have only room for a very few.
The following are from Marchant. “Unless Christ had
been sent, none of us would have been released from our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
iniquities. Wherefore the Apostle often exhorts the
Jews not to glory in the law, for the law did not suffice
to justify and to make alive. Do you desire a figure of
this mystery? Listen to that of Elisha. He was asked
to come and call to life a child which was dead: he sent
his servant first with a staff, which he was to lay upon the
dead child; but neither servant nor staff were of avail.
Then went he himself, and see what he did: ‘He went
up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his
mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon
his hands:’ contracting himself to the form of the child;
‘and the flesh of the child waxed warm … and the
child opened his eyes.’ You see the figure, attend to
the verity. God sent Moses His servant, and the
Prophets, with the staff of the law; but neither they
nor the law could avail to restore man to life from the
death of sin. It was necessary, therefore, that He Himself
should go to man, and bow Himself to man by the
assumption of man’s nature, and contract Himself to the
form of a child by the Incarnation, not only casting
Himself on this our dead nature, but taking our nature,
hands, arms, mouth, and soul to Himself.… This
circumstance of the closing of the door that none might
see, when Elisha stretched himself upon the child, is not
without significance. For as none discerned how Elisha,
that great man, was able to contract himself to the form
of a little boy; so no one can comprehend how the Son
of God, so high and so mighty, could unite, and apply,
and abase, His nature to ours; so that He became
mortal Who was immortal, passible Who was impassible,
infant Who was God. In all these the mystery is great,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the door is shut; it is not necessary for us to see, but it
is necessary for us to believe. We have another figure
in the sign given to Hezekiah. When he was sick unto
death, the sun going back ten degrees was the sign of
his restoration to health. ‘And the sun went back
ten degrees on the dial of Ahaz.’ In like manner, that
man might rise from the sickness unto death of sin, it
was necessary that ‘the Sun of Righteousness’ should
descend through the nine angelic choirs, ‘being made
a little lower than the angels,’ as though going down
nine degrees till He reached man the tenth.”</p>

<p>“The Lord said to Joshua, ‘Moses My servant is
dead: now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou,
and all this people, unto the land which I do give them’
(Joshua i. 2). Joshua is by interpretation a Saviour,
and is the same as Jesus. As he, after conquering
Amalek, brought the people into the land of promise,
and divided the land between them; so has Christ come
to overcome the devil, and to introduce Christians daily
into His Church through the Baptismal stream, and
finally to lead them into glory. Moses could not bring
them in, for the Father saith unto the Son, ‘Moses My
servant is dead.’ The ceremonies of the law are made
of none effect, ‘now, therefore, arise’ from the bosom
of the Father, enter the earth in human form, expel
the devils: ‘go over this Jordan,’ drink of the
brook of Thy Passion in the way, ‘Thou, and all
this people,’ for by the way by which goes the head,
by that must the members go, and where leads the
general, there must follow the soldiers, ‘and go unto the
land which I do give them’—the land of the living, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
which Christ ascends and we follow; to which neither
law nor prophets, no nor Moses, could introduce us, but
only our Joshua, our Jesus, the Son of God.”</p>

<p>I have not yet spoken of the text, except to mention
Maillard as having preached on the same throughout a
season of Lent. Some of the earlier mediæval preachers
delighted in selecting strange texts, and even went so
far as to take them from other books than Holy Scripture.
Indeed Stephen Langton composed a sermon,
still preserved in the British Museum, and published in
Biographia Britannica Literaria, on the text:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Bele Aliz matin leva</div>
<div class="verse">Sun cors vesti e para,</div>
<div class="verse">Enz un verger s’en entra,</div>
<div class="verse">Cink flurettes y truva,</div>
<div class="verse">Un chapelet fet en a</div>
<div class="verse indent3">de rose flurie;</div>
<div class="verse">Pur Deu trahez vus en là,</div>
<div class="verse indent3">vus hi ne amez mie;”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">which was a dancing-song. Maillard also did the same
thing when he preached in Thoulouse, singing at the
top of his voice as a text the ballad “Bergeronnette
Savoisienne.”</p>

<p>Peter of Celles took a stanza from a hymn, and his
example has been followed by others. Hartung preached
from the words, “It fell, it fell, it fell,” occurring in the
parable of the sower.</p>

<p>Texts have sometimes been selected with remarkable
felicity. I have room for two instances only.</p>

<p>In the reign of King James I., a clergyman was to
preach before the Vice Chancellor at Cambridge, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
was a very drowsy person. He took his text from the
twenty-fourth chapter of St. Matthew, “What, can ye
not watch one hour?” and in the course of his sermon
very often repeated these words, which as often roused the
vice-chancellor from his nap, and so irritated him, that
he complained to the bishop. The bishop sent for the
young man, that he might hear what he had to say for
himself in extenuation of the offence; and so well
pleased was he with the preacher’s defence, that he
recommended him to be one of the select preachers
before the King. On the occasion of his occupying
the pulpit before James (First of England and Sixth of
Scotland), he took for his text James i. 6, “Waver
not,” from the translation then in use. This somewhat
startled the King, for it touched him on a weak point;
but he loved a joke, and was so well pleased with the
preacher’s wit, that he appointed him one of his own
chaplains. After this the bishop ordered the young
man to preach again before his university, and make
his peace with the vice-chancellor. He did so, and
took for his text, “Whereas I said before, ‘What, can ye
not watch one hour?’ and it gave offence; I say now
unto you, ‘Sleep on, and take your rest.’” And so
left the university. The other story is less known. A
Capuchin having to preach one day in a church at—I
believe—Lyons, slipped on the steps into the pulpit,
and fell on his head. The Franciscan garb is scanty,
and the congregation were startled by the apparition of
a couple of bare and brawny legs protruded through the
banisters. The unlucky preacher however picked himself
up with great rapidity, and stationing himself in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the pulpit, before the general titter had subsided, gave
out his text, selected with great readiness from the
gospel for the day—“Tell the vision to no man.”</p>

<p>Next to the text in a sermon comes the exordium.</p>

<p>If a royal personage were present, some compliment
was expected to be paid by the preacher to his august
hearer, at the opening of the sermon. Some of the
greatest preachers have injured their reputation by
indulging in unmerited flatteries. Chaussemer, a Jacobite,
preaching after the famous passage of the Rhine,
before Louis XIV. in Holy Week, when according to
custom, the king washed the feet of some poor folk,
used these words, “The haughty waves of the Rhine,
which you, Sire, have passed as rapidly as they themselves
are rapid, shall one day be dried up; but these
drops of water, which your royal hands have sprinkled
over the feet of the poor, shall ever be treasured before
the throne of God.” Noble was the commencement of
a sermon of Father Seraphim, when preaching before
the same monarch. “Sire!” he began, “I am not
ignorant of the fact that custom requires me to address
to you a compliment; I pray your Majesty to excuse
me; I have searched my Bible for a compliment,—I
have found none.” I cannot omit here the really
magnificent exordium of a preacher, who, in his matter
and style, belonged to the seventeenth century, but who
flourished in the eighteenth—I allude to Jacques Brydaine,
born in 1701. He had been a mission-preacher
in the country, when he was suddenly called to preach
at St. Sulpice, before the aristocracy of Paris. The
humble country parson, on mounting the pulpit, saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
that the church was filled with courtiers, nobles, bishops,
and persons of the highest rank. He had been instructed
in the necessity of acknowledging their presence
by a compliment. But listen to the man of God.</p>

<p>“At the sight of an audience so strange to me, my
brethren, it seems that I ought to open my mouth to
ask your favour in behalf of a poor missionary, deficient
in all the talents you require, when he comes before
you to speak of your welfare. But far from it, to-day
I feel a different sentiment; and though I may be
humbled, do not think for one moment that I am
troubled by the miserable anxieties of vanity;—as
though, forsooth, I were preaching myself. God forbid
that a minister of Heaven should ever think it necessary
to excuse himself before such as you! Be you who you
may, you are but like me, sinners before the judgment-seat
of God. It is then only because I stand before
your God and my God, that I am constrained now
to beat my breast. Hitherto I have published the
righteous dealings of the Most High in thatched
temples. I have preached the rigours of penitence to
unhappy ones, the majority of whom were destitute of
bread. I have announced to the good inhabitants of
the fields, the most awful truths of religion. Wretched
one that I am, what have I done! I have saddened
the poor, the best friends of my God; I have carried
terror and pain into the simple and faithful souls which
I should have sympathized with and consoled.</p>

<p>“But here, here, where my eyes rest only on the great,
the rich, the oppressors of suffering humanity, the bold
and hardened in sin; ah! here only is it, here in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
midst of these many scandals, that the word of God
should be uttered with the voice of thunder; here is it
that I must hold up before you, on one hand the death
which threatens you, on the other, my great God who
will judge you all. I hold at this moment your sentence
in my hand. Tremble then before <i>me</i>, you proud
and scornful men who listen to me. Listen when I
speak of your ungrateful abuse of every means of grace,
the necessity of salvation, the certainty of death, the
uncertainty of that hour so terrible to you, final impenitence,
the last judgment, the small number of the
elect, hell, and above all eternity! Eternity! behold
the subjects on which I shall speak, subjects which I
should have reserved for you alone. Ah! what need
I your suffrages, which may, perchance, damn me without
saving you? God Himself will move you, whilst
I, His unworthy minister, speak; for I have acquired a
long experience of His mercies. It is He, and He
alone, who in a few moments will stir the depths of
your consciences.”</p>

<p>Passing from the exordium to the subject: that
which is so tedious in modern sermons is the want of
variety in the matter. There are a stock of subjects of
very limited range upon which changes are rung, but
these subjects are so few that the changes are small in
number. Many years ago I was staying with a relation
in holy orders, after a tour through different watering-places,
and I mentioned to him the curious fact, that on
three consecutive Sundays, in different churches, I had
heard sermons on Felix waiting for a more convenient
season. Having mentioned this, I forgot the circumstance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Five years after I was in a cathedral town,
and went to one of the churches there, on a Sunday
morning. To my surprise I saw my relation sail up
the nave in rustling silk, preceded by the verger, escorting
him to the pulpit. As he passed my pew, our eyes
met. He was as surprised to see me as I was to see
him, as he was only a visitor like myself. I noticed
signs of agitation in his countenance, and that he was
some time before he delivered his text, which was upon
Zaccheus in the sycamore-tree.</p>

<p>After service I waited for him, and on our meeting,
his first words were, “You wretched fellow! You put
me terribly out; I had Felix trembling in my pocket
ready for delivery; but when I saw you, our conversation
five years ago flashed across me, and I had to
change the sermon in the pulpit.” But this was not
all. Next Saturday I was at the other end of England,
staying with a country parson, and I related this incident.
My host pulled a long face, broke out into a
profuse perspiration, and said,—“I am really very sorry,
but I had prepared Felix for to-morrow, and what is
more, I do not see my way towards changing the subject.”</p>

<p>The remarkable part of this anecdote is, that the
moral application was similar in all these discourses.
Now, the sermons of the divines of the fifteenth, sixteenth,
and seventeenth centuries seldom offended in
this manner. Matthias Faber published three enormous
volumes of sermons for every Sunday in the year, containing
some fifteen discourses for each, and they are
perfectly varied in matter and in application.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>The following is a list of the subjects for one Sunday—the
second in Lent:—</p>

<p class="sermon">St. Matt. xvii. “He was transfigured before them.”</p>

<p class="sermon">Sermon I.—The means whereby a hardened sinner
may be transformed into a new man, and his heart be
softened.</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>1. By constantly hearing God’s Word.</p>

<p>2. By assiduous prayer.</p>

<p>3. By earnest endeavour.</p>

<p>4. By diligent practice of virtues.</p>

</div>

<p class="sermon">Sermon II.—The incidents which took place on
Mount Tabor, and the lessons they give us.</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>1. By labour must we pass to glory, for it was
“after six days” and a laborious ascent that
the mountain-top was reached.</p>

<p>2. Beatitude is to be sought above, not on earth,
for the disciples were rebuked for desiring
to make tabernacles on earth, the true
tabernacle being in heaven.</p>

<p>3. In every act we should consider the end: thus
Christ in the glory spoke of His approaching
decease.</p>

<p>4. Those who would see the glory of God must
watch.</p>

<p>5. Christ is to be heard by all, for He is glorified
of His Father.</p>

<p>6. Christ’s passion to be constantly before the
minds of His servants.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p class="sermon">Sermon III.—What might be seen on Mount Tabor.</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>1. The glory of Christ.</p>

<p>2. Our own future glory, the reflex of His.</p>

<p>3. The vanity of worldly glory.</p>

<p>4. The certainty of future judgment<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>.</p>

</div>

<p class="sermon">Sermon IV.—Why Christ in His passion made His decease
(<i>excessum</i>). The point of this sermon depends on the
various significations of the Vulgate expression, <i>excessus</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>1. He deceased (<i>excessit</i>) to show us how great an
evil is sin.</p>

<p>2. To show us His fervent love.</p>

<p>3. To compensate for our evil deaths by His most
perfect and holy death.</p>

<p>4. To compensate for our defects by His superabundant
merits.</p>

</div>

<p class="sermon">Sermon V.—Pious exercises for the season of Lent.</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>1. The exercise of fasting; set before us by the
example of Moses and Elias, each of whom
fasted during forty days.</p>

<p>2. The exercise of prayer; set before us by the
example of Christ, who was transfigured
“as He prayed.” (Luke ix. 29.)</p>

<p>3. The exercise of conversion; set before us by
Christ’s raiment becoming white and glistering;
teaching us that we must wash our
robes, and make them white in the blood of
the Lamb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>4. The exercise of making devout use of God’s
Word; “This is My beloved Son, in whom I
am well pleased; hear ye Him.”</p>

<p>5. The exercise of the memory of Christ’s passion;
by the example of Moses and Elias talking
with Him of “His decease which He should
accomplish at Jerusalem.”</p>

<p>6. The exercise of present opportunities of grace,
before the cloud obscures Christ, and ye
desire “to see one of the days of the Son of
Man, and shall not see it.”</p>

</div>

<p class="sermon">Sermon VI.—The transfiguration of Satan into an
angel of light, and how he deceives men.</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>1. He leads them into the high mountain of pride,
that thence he may cast them down.</p>

<p>2. He dazzles by the splendour of his countenance.</p>

<p>3. He puts on a show of virtue, like glistering
raiment.</p>

<p>4. He brings upon men a cloud of doubts and
difficulties and worldly delights.</p>

<p>5. From that cloud he utters a loud voice, filling
men with fear at the difficulties besetting
them if they would begin the service of God.</p>

<p>6. He chooses his apostles.</p>

<p>7. He produces Elias; example of indiscreet zeal.</p>

<p>8. He brings forward Moses; example of exaggerated
meekness.</p>

</div>

<p class="sermon">Sermon VII.—Eternal good things offered us by
God: what they are and what their nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>1. They are solid and true. For the transfiguration
was not a mere dreaming vision, but
seen when the three “were awake.”</p>

<p>2. They are pure and sincere; unmixed with care,
or pain, or toil.</p>

<p>3. They are secure and stable.</p>

<p>4. They are perfect and complete.</p>

<p>5. They are realities, not promises.</p>

<p>6. They are bought at a low price.</p>

</div>

<p class="sermon">Sermon VIII.—Wherefore Christ was transfigured.</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>1. To establish our faith in the resurrection.</p>

<p>2. To excite our hope.</p>

<p>3. To kindle our love.</p>

<p>4. To console the Church.</p>

<p>5. To show who He was.</p>

<p>6. To teach us to despise the world.</p>

<p>7. To give a moment’s joy to His body, wearied
with fasting, watching, and toil.</p>

</div>

<p class="sermon">Sermon IX.—The great Parliament held on Tabor,
and what was treated of there.</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>1. The death of Christ was discussed.</p>

<p>2. The glory of Christ the Mediator and Legislator.</p>

<p>3. The imperial laws were drawn up; that</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>α. The cross should precede the crown;</p>

<p>β. The end should be held ever in view;</p>

<p>γ. Beatitude should be sought above;</p>

<p>δ. The passion should ever be had in remembrance.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class="sermon">Sermon X.—On the meaning of <i>excessus</i>.</p>

<p class="sermon">Sermon XI.—Man’s fourfold transfiguration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>1. From a state of grace into one of sin.</p>

<p>2. From a state of sin into a state of grace.</p>

<p>3. From the state of delight in this world into the
misery of hell.</p>

<p>4. From the state of pain here to the glory of
Heaven.</p>

</div>

<p class="sermon">Sermon XII.—The five sources of joy to the redeemed.</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>1. The place—Heaven.</p>

<p>2. The society of the blessed.</p>

<p>3. The delights of the senses, especially of the eyes
and ears.</p>

<p>4. The dowers of the risen body; glory, agility,
subtlety, and impassibility.</p>

<p>5. The beatific vision of God.</p>

are to be held.</p>

<p>These sermons of Matthias Faber, and indeed most of
the sermons of great preachers in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries, are very simple in construction.
The system of dividing into a great number of heads,
and then subdividing, had been cast aside by the Catholic
preachers at the Reformation, as unprofitable. But
Protestant orators continued the baneful practice. It
prevailed till lately in England, and is common still in
Scotland. Dr. Neale remarks, “One would think, to
read some of the essays written on the subject, that the
construction of a sermon was like a law of the Medes
and Persians. Look at Mr. Simeon’s one-and-twenty
tedious volumes of ‘Horæ Homileticæ.’ The worthy
man evidently considered this the greatest system of
divinity which English theology had ever produced.
And of what does it consist? of several thousand sermons
treated exactly in the same ways, in obedience to
precisely the same laws, and of much about the same
length. Claude’s Essay had laid down certain rules,
and Simeon’s Discourses were their exemplification.…
The preacher opens with a short view of the circumstances
under which the text was spoken. This is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
a very convenient exordium, because it fills two or three
pages with but little trouble. The clergyman has only
to put Scripture language into his own, and he is fairly
launched in his sermon without any effort. Another
almost equally easy method of opening is to be found
in drawing a contrast between the person or thing of
which the passage in hand speaks, and that to which
the writer may wish to allude. And it has this special
advantage; that if he is unlucky in finding much likeness
between the two, he is sure to discover a good
deal of <i>un</i>-likeness, and either treatment will supply a
good number of words. Thus, as every one knows,
come the heads,—a most important part in this style of
discourse. Taking Mr. Simeon as a pattern, we shall find
that they cannot be less than two, nor more than four;
though, indeed, there are not wanting those who have
greatly extravagated beyond the superior limit, as the
Puritan divine’s ‘And now, to be brief, I would observe
eighteenthly, that—’ so and so, may suffice to prove.
Then come all the minutiæ of subdivisions and underdivisions
(little heads, as the charity children call them),
all set forth, when the aforesaid discourses came to be
printed, in corresponding variations of type.” After
a lengthy exordium, one Sunday evening, a preacher
divided his subject into twenty heads, each of which he
purposed D.V. considering in all its bearings. On
hearing this, a man in the congregation started up and
proceeded to leave the church, when the preacher called
to him, “Wherefore leave, friend?” “I am going for
my nightcap,” replied the man; “for I plainly see that
we shall have to pass the night in church.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>The conclusion in an old sermon of the three centuries
under review, is short, pithy, and to the purpose.
It consists in a vehement appeal to the consciences of
the hearers, in the application of a parable or a Scriptural
illustration, in a rapturous exclamation to God in
the form of a brief extempore prayer, or in a string of
anecdotes and examples. The following is a conclusion
by Guevara, Bishop of Mondoneda:—</p>

<p>“Tell me, O good Jesu, tell me, is there any thing in
a rotten sepulchre which is not in my sorrowful soul
and unhappy life? In me more than in any shall be
found hard stones of obstinacy, a painted sepulchre of
hypocrisy, dry bones of old sins, unprofitable ashes of
works without fruit, gnawing worms of great concupiscence,
and an ill odour of an evil conscience. What,
then, will become of me, O good Jesu! if Thou do not
break the stones of my faults, throw down the sepulchre
of my hypocrisy, reform the bones of my sins, and sift
the ashes of my unruly desires? Raise me up, then, O
good Jesu! raise me now up: not from among the
dead which sleep, but from among sins which stink, for
that the justification of a wicked man is a far greater
matter than the raising up of a dead man; because that
in the one Thou dost use Thy power, and in the other
Thou dost exert Thy clemency.”</p>

<p>Many of Paoletti’s sermons conclude with a string
of incidents and stories, from which I presume any
preacher using the sermon might select that which
seemed to him most appropriate.</p>

<p>The effect produced by the sermons of these ancient
preachers was sometimes extraordinary. Jerome de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Narni preached one day before the Pope, with such zeal,
on the duties of residence, that next day, thirty bishops
fled from Rome to their several dioceses. St. John
Capistran, a Franciscan, preached in 1452 at Nuremberg,
in the great square of the town, and he spoke
with such vehemence against gambling, that the inhabitants
brought out their dice, cards, and tables, heaped
them up and burned them before him. The same thing
happened next year at Breslau. Of the marvellous
conversions, the result of their powerful preaching, of
course we can know but little, though there is evidence
that they were neither few nor unenduring. It was
not an uncommon thing for people to throw themselves
at the foot of the pulpit, and denounce themselves of
crimes they had committed, or to throng the preacher
after the sermon was over, earnestly desiring him to
hear their confessions. But the most original scene,
the result of a sermon of great power, exhorting to confession
and amendment, took place in a church at Turin,
during Lent in 1780. After the most touching appeal
of the preacher, a man stood up and began to confess
his sins aloud. He said that he was a lawyer, and that
his life had been one of extortion. He mentioned the
names of several families which he had pillaged, widows’
houses he had devoured, orphans’ substance which he
had conveyed into his own pocket. This went on for
some little while, when suddenly a gentleman on the
other side of the church sprang up, and in a voice
choking with rage, exclaimed, “Don’t believe him! it
is not true. The good-for-nothing fellow is describing
me and my acts; but I never did any thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
of the kind!” It was evident to all that the cap
fitted.</p>

<p>The story is told of a rich usurer of Vicenza urging
the ecclesiastical authorities of the town to send for an
eminent preacher to declaim against usury. “He has
converted many usurers in various towns of Italy,” said
the man, “and I should not in the least scruple to
pay some of the expense of his coming here.” “But,”
said the clergyman to whom he spoke, “if you are
determined on your own conversion, you surely need
not the exhortations of a preacher to strengthen your
resolutions.” “Oh!” replied the usurer, “it is not for
myself. This town is so full of usurers, that there is no
room for a poor fellow like me to gain a livelihood.
Now if they were all converted, and gave up their evil
habits, there would be some chance of my being able
to pick up a living.”</p>

<p>There were, indeed, preachers who were sent round
the country to declaim against certain special sins.
Their <i>forte</i> lay in attacking one species of guilt, but
they were ineffective when preaching on another point.
There were preachers whose strength lay in panegyrics
upon saints; and others who—I pity them—were great
in funereal discourses. Of the latter class was Geminiano,
a Dominican, whose “sermones funebres” were
published at Antwerp in octavo, 1611. They are ninety-eight
in number. He preached over the graves of
popes, archbishops, bishops, abbots, soldiers, doctors,
rich men and beggars, beautiful women, an emperor,
a drowned man, a prisoner who died in jail, an executed
criminal, and a murdered man or two; he preached at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the interment of merchants, fishermen, ploughmen, and
huntsmen—in short, it would be hard to find some over
whom John Geminiano did not dolorously hold forth.
A sad moment for Geminiano when he first let people
understand that his strong point lay in a grave.</p>

<p>A really great preacher was never suffered to hide
his light under a bushel; according to our parochial
system, the most eloquent man of the day may, for
aught we know, be perched on the top of a Wiltshire
down, or be buried in the clay of a North Devon parsonage,
fifteen miles from a railway.</p>

<p>The Roman Church had the regular clergy to draw
upon for preachers, and as they had no ties, could send
them up and down the country, so that the same course
of sermons would serve them again and again. Indeed,
otherwise it would have been impossible for some of the
favourite preachers to have continued providing fresh
matter and committing it to memory, for it must be
remembered written sermons are not tolerated in the
Roman communion. It might be possible for an eloquent
man with a lively imagination to continue for
long without exhausting himself, but how could a solid
and learned preacher, who relied on quotations, continue
extracting and committing to memory long paragraphs
from the Fathers, Sunday after Sunday, and year after
year? Let us take a sermon of Mangotius the Jesuit,
for instance.</p>

<p>Adrian Mangotius was a Dutchman, and consequently
eminently practical and unimaginative. His sermons
are good in their way; there is not a bit of originality
in them, but the fragments of which they are composed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
are judiciously selected. In his fifty-ninth discourse,
he quotes St. Matthew four times, St. Luke thrice, St.
John twice, the Epistles five times, Revelation once, the
Old Testament ten times, St. Augustine a dozen times,
St. Gregory four times, St. Ambrose twice, St. Jerome
twice, St. Bernard twice, St. Thomas Aquinas once,
Cicero some three or four times, Plutarch, Sallust, and
Virgil once.</p>

<p>This style of sermon suits some people, perhaps, but
it did not take with the masses, who liked richness of
imagery, abundance of simile, and neatness of illustration.
So when Father d’Harrone, a man of sound
learning, but little brilliancy of genius, preached a
course in Rouen, after the great Bourdaloue, to use his
own words:—“When Bourdaloue preached last year
at Rouen, artisans quitted their business, merchants
their wares, lawyers the court, doctors their sick; but
as for me, when I followed, I set all in order again; no
one neglected his occupation.”</p>

<p>In the following pages I have given a sketch of some
of the most remarkable preachers of the fifteenth, sixteenth,
and seventeenth centuries. The divine and the
bibliographer may miss the names of some great and
eminent men, as Paolo Segneri, Antonio Vieyra,
Latimer, Andrewes, &amp;c. But these men are either well
known, or their lives and sermons are within the reach
of English readers. Segneri’s Lenten sermons have
been translated and somewhat diluted by Prebendary
Ford, Vieyra is noticed in “Mediæval Sermons,” and
English preachers I have omitted entirely to notice,
because they are for the most part hopelessly dull.</p>

<h2 id="GABRIEL_BIEL">GABRIEL BIEL.</h2>

<p>This excellent and learned man is generally supposed,
from his name Biel, the modern Bienne, to have been a
Swiss, though some assert that he was a native of Spire,
and the latter is probably the real place of his nativity,
though his family may have been of Swiss extraction,
for he is called “Gabriel Biel ex Spira” in the beginning
of his “Sermones de tempore,” as published by Johan
Otmar, in Tubingen, 1510.</p>

<p>He went by the name of “the Collector,” from the
fact of his being a laborious compiler rather than an
original composer.</p>

<p>He was undoubtedly one of the best scholastic divines
of his age, and was a careful reader of the Fathers.</p>

<p>Gabriel Biel was a member of the Regular Canons,
and was Doctor of Theology, which he taught as professor
in the University of Tubingen, founded by Count
Eberhardt of Wirtemberg, in 1477.</p>

<p>He soon became a favourite with this nobleman, who
listened to his sermons with delight.</p>

<p>At one time he was vicar and ordinary preacher at
the metropolitan church of St. Martin at Mainz, but the
date of his appointment is uncertain. Gabriel Biel was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
a man of gravity and learning; his sermons were popular,
not on account of the eloquence with which they were
delivered, for of that there was little, but of their
beautiful simplicity and intrinsic excellence.</p>

<p>His hearers were not amused by his discourses, but I
venture to say that they were edified.</p>

<p>His style is pithy, his sentences pregnant with
meaning, for what he said, he said in few words, and
he said it too very gracefully. Instead of wearying his
hearers with unprofitable scholastic quibbles, he gave
them practical good advice in plain and homely words.</p>

<p>The date of his death is not known with certainty,
but it probably took place in 1495, though, according
to some, he lived till 1520.</p>

<p>His works and their different editions are:—</p>

<p>The Exposition of the Mass which passes under the
name of Biel is really a copy from the work of Eggeling
of Brunswick, as, indeed, Biel owns at the end of the
book.</p>

<p>The simple earnestness of Gabriel Biel renders his
sermons very attractive; and as being the production of
a well-read and a thoughtful man, these sermons furnish
ample material for reproduction in the modern pulpit.
The reader will not find in Biel much of the fire of the
Italian pulpit, nor the richness of simile which characterized
the Spanish preachers, but he will find plain
truths drawn from Scripture in a very straightforward
manner, and applied in short but nervous sentences.</p>

<p>Perhaps the main difference between a sermon of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Biel and one of a modern preacher, is, that the former
contains many thoughts in few words, whilst the latter
consists of many words, but contains few thoughts.</p>

<p class="sermon">Analysis of Sermon xix. “De tempore,” being a
sermon for Septuagesima, on the text from the Gospel:
“The kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an
householder, which went out early in the morning to
hire labourers into his vineyard,” &amp;c. (Matt. xx. 1.)</p>

<p>Introduction.</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>Hitherto the Church has been keeping festival.
Now she closes her season of festivity, that
she may lament and weep for the lapse of her
sons.</p>

<p>A. (1) Man’s <i>nature</i> as it left the Creator’s hands
was very noble. It was immortal, not by
nature, but by grace. By nature it was
capable of decay and death, but by grace it
was provided with the tree of life, the fruit
of which renovated and preserved it.</p>

<p>(2) Man’s <i>life</i> was maintained subject to a condition,
the condition of obedience. Its preservation
was contingent on the keeping of
God’s commandment.</p>

<p class="not">The soul as created was innocent; man was
wise in intellect and clean in affections; he
was associated with angels, accustomed to converse
with God, peaceful in conscience, and
endowed with all gifts of nature and grace.</p>

<p>(3) Man’s <i>knowledge</i> of God was not enigmatical,
but intuitive. He saw God by some internal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
power of contemplation: a power not so perfect
as that will be which we shall possess in
our country, nor so imperfect as that which
we have in the way.</p>

<p>(4) Man’s <i>conscience</i> was at peace with God; and
internal peace implies external peace as well.
Paradise was a place of perfect peace, for the
elements were tranquil, the animals were in
subjection, nourishment was in abundance.</p>

<p class="not">Had this state of peace continued, man
would not have died, but he would have been
translated to Heaven without death.</p>

<p>(5) But alas! all this was forfeited by sin; and
man was spoiled of his graces, and wounded
in his faculties.</p>

<p class="not">He lost original righteousness, and with its
loss his tranquillity was disturbed, his flesh
became unbridled, his intellect parched, his
will depraved, his memory disturbed.</p>

<p>(6) Creation was moreover armed against him, so
that earth was no more ready to nourish him
spontaneously; but he was constrained to labour
in the sweat of his brow for his daily
bread.</p>

<p>B. And now we are led to a consideration of the
Gospel for the day, which speaks of fallen
man, and of fallen man working, and working
moreover to recover the conditions which he
had before he fell.</p>

<p>The Gospel is full of doctrine and dogma suited to
all conditions of men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Doctrine I. is serviceable for increasing our faith.
For the Gospel teaches us that in no other
way can we attain the reward of the kingdom,
than by working with true faith in the Lord’s
vineyard, which is the Church.</p>

<p>It is not sufficient that we should be called, we
must work as well.</p>

<p>Work is not sufficient, unless it be work in the
Lord’s vineyard.</p>

<p>Work in vineyards of our own planting will never
be paid for by the Lord of the vineyard, when
He comes to give the labourers their hire.</p>

<p>Again; this Gospel opposes the presumption of
those carnally-minded men who think to be
saved by faith only; whereas faith without
works is dead, being alone.</p>

<p>Doctrine II. giveth hope. For it shows that the
kingdom of Heaven is open to all, and closed
to none; all are called to the work, even though
it be at the last hour. So long as there is life
there is hope.</p>

<p>Again; this Gospel, at the same time as it
shows that none should despair, opposes all sloth
and cowardice in undertaking the work of the
salvation of the soul.</p>

<p>Doctrine III. inflames charity. For it exhibits to
us in a remarkable manner the love of the
Father towards man; a love which embraces
all, and rejects none; a love ready to reward
both the righteous and the unrighteous, both
the good and the bad, if the unrighteous and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
bad will but turn from their evil ways, and be
converted, that He may heal them. Examples
of those called at late stages of life, and yet
meriting a reward equal to those who have
borne the burden and heat of the day, are
afforded by David, St. Peter, St. Paul, St.
Matthew, and St. Mary Magdalen.</p>

<p class="not">Again; by this Gospel all excuse is removed
from those who neglect the work of their
salvation, for no man can say that he has
not been hired, inasmuch as God calls him
throughout life; calling him externally and
internally,—externally, by the beauty of
creation, by the Holy Scriptures, by preaching,
by the scourge of afflictions; internally,
by shame at sin committed, by fear occasioned
by the knowledge of the uncertainty of the
hour of death, by dread of judgment, by horror
of hell, by promises of absolution, of glory,
and by aspirations of love for the mysteries of
Redemption.</p>

<p>Doctrine IV. induces to humility. For it shows us
that no man should puff himself up with spiritual
pride, because he may have laboured long
in his Lord’s vineyard, or may have been kept
free from falling into heinous crimes; by this
Gospel he is taught that many that are first
shall be last, and the last shall be first. “Why
dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost
thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall
all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
“Therefore judge nothing before the time,
until the Lord come, who both will bring
to light the hidden things of darkness, and
will make manifest the counsels of the hearts;
and then shall every man have praise of God.”</p>

<p>Doctrine V. urges to the fear of God, lest by delay
in undertaking the work of his conversion,
man should neglect the call of God to work,
and lest he thereby lose his hire.</p>

<p class="not">“Let him that thinketh he standeth, take
heed lest he fall.” “Watch ye, therefore,
for ye know not when the Master of the
house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or
at the cock-crowing, or in the morning: lest
coming suddenly, He find you sleeping.”</p>

<p>Conclusion. Finally, let all keep in mind the
awful sentence of Him who cannot err: “Many
are called, but few are chosen.” Let each fear
for himself, lest he be found among the number
of the called who have neglected the vocation;
and let him strive by all means in his power
to be of the number of the chosen.</p>

</div>

<p>This sermon is followed by another on the same
Gospel; the subject being, the small number of the
elect.</p>

<p>The analysis given will show how wholesome and
practical were the discourses of this truly pious and
learned man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="JEAN_RAULIN">JEAN RAULIN.</h2>

<p>John Raulin, born at Toul in 1443, of noble and
wealthy parents, was educated at the Navarre College
in Paris, and took honours in theology in the year
1479.</p>

<p>In 1481 he was elected President in the place of
William de Châteaufort, and he filled the position with
the utmost probity, and ruled with singular discretion.</p>

<p>In 1497 he resigned the mastership and retired to
Cluni, where he lived a life of great sanctity.</p>

<p>In 1501 he obtained a commission from Cardinal
Ambassiani to introduce a reform into the Benedictine
Order. He died at Paris in the Cluniac monastery, on
February 6th, 1514, aged seventy-one.</p>

<p>Raulin was a man of considerable piety, of blameless
life, and of the utmost integrity. He seems to have
been regarded in his day as a great preacher, and his
sermons have been several times republished. Those
for Advent have passed through six editions, and those
for Lent through five.</p>

<p>Besides sermons, he wrote a “Doctrinale” on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
triple death,—the death of the body, the death in sin,
and the last or eternal death. He is also the author of
a volume of letters and tracts on the reform of the
Cluniacs; also of “The Itinerary of Paradise,” “A
Discourse on the Reformation of the Clergy,” and a
“Commentary on Aristotle’s Logic.”</p>

<p>He was a dry and methodical preacher, vehement
in his denunciations of the corruptions in Church and
State, and ready unscrupulously to attack all abuses
in ecclesiastical discipline. His style is wholly devoid
of eloquence, and is precise and dull. His sermons are
full of divisions and subdivisions, which could never
have fixed themselves in the minds of his audience, and
serve only to perplex his readers. They are wanting
in almost every particular which would make a sermon
tolerable now-a-days; and after a lengthened perusal,
one rises from the volumes wondering how there could
have been found hearers to listen to such discourses, or
readers sufficiently numerous to necessitate a rapid succession
of editions.</p>

<p>As a representative man of a type common enough
in the century which produced him, he is valuable. For
the age and the taste of his period, he is grave; but he
sometimes sinks almost as deep in buffoonery as Menot,
Meffreth, or Oliver Maillard.</p>

<p>As an example, taken at hazard, of one of his sermons,
I will give a short outline of his Epiphany discourse
on the text—“It is the Lord that commandeth
the waters; it is the glorious God that maketh the
thunder; it is the Lord that ruleth the sea.” (Ps. xxix.
3, 4.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>Question. Was it of necessity that Christ should be
baptized?</p>

<p>Answer. No; for reasons taken from St. Bernard
and St. Chrysostom.</p>

<p>Christ however consented to be baptized for three
reasons,—</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>1. To set an example to us.</p>

<p>2. To conceal Himself from Satan, who beholding
Him baptized might hesitate to regard
Him as the Messiah.</p>

<p>3. To show His perfect humility.</p>

</div>

<p>In the baptism of our Lord, there were three manifestations:
the Son in His humanity, the Father by the
voice, the Holy Ghost by the descent of the dove.</p>

<p>Then follows an exhortation to humility, and a warning
to priests and people to practise godliness instead
of contenting themselves with professing it. “The
hand is bigger than the tongue,” hints Raulin.</p>

<p>The Son was manifest in His humanity. A question
is asked:—Did John Baptist recognize Christ?</p>

<p>Answer:—</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>1. He recognized Him when He was unborn,
“The babe leaped in my womb for joy;” but
he did not distinctly know Him now, for—the
reason given is perfectly monstrous—Aristotle
says that the human frame changes every
seven years.</p>

<p>2. He knew that Christ was among the throng by
a sort of inspiration, but he knew not which
of his hearers was Christ.</p>

<p>3. Knowledge is double; it arises out of</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>α. Demonstration, and is acquired by reason.</p>

<p>β. Experience.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>Raulin investigates the knowledge of John, and
resolves the question by stating that at first he had
no certain knowledge, but that after the manifestations
accompanying the baptism, he obtained it by
experience.</p>

<p>A second question is asked:—Why St. John Baptist
did not venture to touch Christ?</p>

<p>Answer:—</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>1. Because he had an instinctive fear of God present
in the flesh.</p>

<p>2. Because he was conscious of his own sinfulness.</p>

</div>

<p>The Father was manifest by the voice.</p>

<p>In holy baptism all men are made in like manner
children of God. We are made children,</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>1. By adoption—to the Father.</p>

<p>2. By ingrafting—to the Church.</p>

<p>3. By spiritual generation—to the priest who
baptizes.</p>

</div>

<p>From this arises the question:—Did St. John the
Baptist become spiritual father of our Lord by baptizing
Him?</p>

<p>This Raulin answers in the negative; for,</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>1. Christ received not grace through the ministration
of John; for He was full of grace from
the moment of His conception.</p>

<p>2. The rite was imperfect.</p>

<p>3. It was a baptism of repentance, which could not
avail spiritually one who had never sinned.</p>

</div>

<p>The Spirit was manifest under the form of a dove.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>The dove appeared above water, and here follows a
dissertation on the virtues of divers waters.</p>

<p>The question arises:—Why did the Spirit elect the
form of a dove?</p>

<p>This Raulin answers in the following manner:</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>1. A dove is without gall, and is harmless, and
therefore represents the character of those
born of the Spirit.</p>

<p>2. A dove bore the olive-branch to the ark, in
token of God being reconciled. And by baptism
we are reconciled to God.</p>

<p>3. A dove has seven qualities, resembling the
Spirit’s sevenfold gifts. These are,—</p>

<p>(1) It moans instead of warbling; this represents
the spirit of holy <i>Fear</i>.</p>

<p>(2) It is a gentle bird, and is offered in sacrifice;
thus representing the spirit of <i>Piety</i>.</p>

<p>(3) It is granivorous, not carnivorous; thus it shadows
forth the spirit of <i>Knowledge</i>.</p>

<p>(4) It dwells in the clefts of the rock; thus exhibiting
the character of the spirit of <i>Fortitude</i>.</p>

<p>(5) It brings up the young of others; thus showing
forth the spirit of <i>Counsel</i>.</p>

<p>(6) It rends not what it eats, but swallows whole;
a type of the spirit of <i>Understanding</i>.</p>

<p>(7) It dwells beside waters; thereby exhibiting the
marks of the spirit of <i>Wisdom</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>All these points are drawn out at length, and examined
minutely; Scripture is tortured to illustrate them, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
illustrations of a most unsuitable nature are brought to
bear upon them.</p>

<p>It will be seen from this abstract, how thoroughly
unprofitable the sermons of Jean Raulin prove to be;
they bear the character of playing and trifling with
Scripture and with the most sacred subjects, and it is
sad to think that a good and blameless man, such as he
was, should have degraded the ministry of God’s Word
to a mere tissue of Sunday puzzles.</p>

<p>Raulin delighted in far-fetched similes, and in
tracing out types beyond all limits of endurance. That
of the dove was sufficiently extravagant, but what can
we say to his working out the details of the parable of
the Miraculous Draught of Fishes, in such a manner as
to make the little fishes resemble the faithful in the
Church, because,</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>(1) Fish have their eyes at their sides, and so
can always see about them; and faithful
Christians are ever watchful.</p>

<p>(2) Fish advance in the water by wagging their
tails; and good Christians have to advance by
remembering the end of all things!!</p>

<p>(3) Little fish are eaten by big fish, and so of the
faithful it is said, “Men shall devour you.”</p>

</div>

<p>Occasionally Jean Raulin tells a story to enliven his
discourse—stories in the pulpit were in vogue then—and
these anecdotes and fables are often exceedingly
good and pointed, but they are most unsuited to a
sermon.</p>

<p>On one occasion, when preaching on the corruptions
in the Church, and declaiming against the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
in which the clergy condoned moral sins of the blackest
dye, but showed the utmost severity when the slightest
injury was done to the temporal welfare of the Church,
he illustrated his subject by a story to this effect:</p>

<p>The beasts were once determined to keep Lent
strictly, and to begin by making their confessions.
The Lion was appointed confessor. First to be shriven
came the Wolf, who with expressions of remorse acknowledged
himself a grievous sinner, and confessed that
he had—yes, he had—once eaten a lamb.</p>

<p>“Any extenuating circumstances?” asked the Lion.</p>

<p>“Well, yes, there were,” quoth the Wolf; “for the
mother who bore me, and my ancestors from time immemorial,
have been notable lamb-eaters, and ‘what’s
born in the bone comes out in the flesh.’”</p>

<p>“Quite so,” said the confessor; “your penance is
this,—say one Pater Noster.”</p>

<p>The next to approach the tribunal of penance was
the Fox, with drooping tail, a lachrymose eye, and
humble gait.</p>

<p>“I have sinned, father!” began Reynard, beating
his breast; “I have sinned grievously through my own
fault; I—I—I—yes, I once did eat a hen.”</p>

<p>“Any extenuating circumstances?” asked the Lion.</p>

<p>“Two,” replied the penitent; “I must say, the fault
was not quite my own. The hen was grossly fat, and
it roosted within reach. Now, had she been an ascetic,
and had she gone to sleep in some tree, I should never
have touched her, I assure you, father.”</p>

<p>“There is some truth in that,” said the confessor;
“say as penance one Pater Noster.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Next came the Donkey, hobbling up to the confessional,
and her broken ee-yaws! could be heard from
quite a distance. For some time the poor brute was so
convulsed with sobs that not a word she said could be
distinguished. At last she gulped forth that she had
sinned in three things.</p>

<p>“And what are they?” asked the Lion gruffly.</p>

<p>“Oh, father! first of all, as I went along the roads,
I found grass and thistles in the hedges; they were <i>so</i>
tempting that—that—that—ee-yaw, ee-yaw!”</p>

<p>“Go on,” growled the Lion; “you ate them; you
committed robbery.—Vile monster! I shudder at the
enormity of your crime.”</p>

<p>“Secondly,” continued the Donkey, “as I came near
a monastery one summer’s day, the gates were wide
open to air the cloisters; impelled by curiosity, I—I—I—just
ventured to walk in, and I think I may have
somewhat befouled the pavement.”</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed the confessor, rising in his
seat, and shaking his mane; “enter the sanctuary dedicated
to religion—<i>you</i>, a female, knowing that it is
against the rules of the order that aught but males
should intrude; and then, too, that little circumstance
about the pavement! Go on,” said the Lion grimly.</p>

<p>“Oh, father!” sighed the poor penitent; “the holy
monks were all in chapel, and singing the office. They
sang so beautifully that my heart was lifted up within
me, and at the close of a collect my feelings overcame
me, and I tried to say Amen; but produced only an
ee-yaw! which interrupted the service and hindered
the devotion of the monks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>“Horrible!” cried the Lion, his eyes flashing with
pious zeal, his hair bristling with virtuous indignation.
“Monster steeped in crime, is there any penance too
great to inflict on you? I—” The reader may guess
what became of the helpless beast.</p>

<p>This story, which I have related in my own words,
instead of giving a literal translation, must have been a
cutting satire on the practices of the clergy of that
period, and as true as it was cutting; but the pulpit
was not the place for it.</p>

<p>Another of Raulin’s beast fables is good. It occurs in
a sermon on St. Nicolas. He is speaking of the persuasion
which parents have that their children are perfect
spiritually and corporeally. Once an old toad had a
son who was fond of church-going—so fond, indeed, that
in the ardour of his devotion he went one day without
his socks. This troubled the old toad, as his son was
liable to colds in the head if he caught chills in his feet.
Seeing the hare dashing by, he called out, “Hey! you,
there! going to church, I suppose? Do me a good turn
and take my son his socks, or he’ll get his death of cold.”</p>

<p>“But how am I to know your son?”</p>

<p>“Nothing more easy,” replied the toad; “there’s not
such a good-looking fellow in the crowd.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I know him,” said the hare; “we call him the
swan.”</p>

<p>“Swan!” expressed in a tone of contempt, “swan!
a fellow with great splay feet and a neck you might tie
in a knot!”</p>

<p>“Well, let me see! I know him; he is the peacock.”</p>

<p>The toad screamed with dismay. “How can you insult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
me by thinking that cracked-voiced thing my son?”
and he puffed himself up to the shape of a ball.</p>

<p>“Then how am I to know your son?”</p>

<p>“Why, look you,” pumped forth the toad with stateliness,
“he is remarkably handsome—ahem! he is the
image of me: has goggle eyes, a blotched back, and a
great white belly!”</p>

<p>Now, could any congregation hear this story from the
pulpit without laughing? It is sufficiently <i>piquant</i>, and
would go home to many parents present.</p>

<p>There is a capital story which I believe originated
with Raulin, but which has since been versified by
Southey, and even dramatized; but it may be questioned
whether any modern author has told it with any thing
like the <i>naïveté</i> of the original.</p>

<p>It occurs in the third sermon on widowhood. I give
it in the Latin of the period.</p>

<p>“Dicatur de quâdam viduâ, quod venit ad curatum
suum (à son curé), quærens ab eo consilium, si deberet
iterum maritari, et allegabat quod erat sine adjutorio, et
quod habebat servum optimum et peritum in arte mariti
sui.</p>

<p>“Tunc curatus: ‘Bene, accipite eum.’</p>

<p>“E contrario illa dicebat: ‘Sed periculum est accipere
illum, ne de servo meo faciam dominum.’</p>

<p>“Tunc curatus dixit: ‘Bene, nolite eum accipere.’</p>

<p>“Ait illa: ‘Quid faciam? non possum sustinere pondus
illud quod sustinebat maritus meus, nisi unum habeam.’</p>

<p>“Tunc curatus dixit: ‘Bene, habeatis eum.’</p>

<p>“At illa: ‘Sed si malus esset, et vellet mea disperdere
et usurpare?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>“Tunc curatus: ‘Non accipiatis ergo eum.’</p>

<p>“Et sic semper curatus juxta argumenta sua concedebat
ei. Videns autem curatus quod vellet illum habere et
haberet devotionem ad eum, dixit ei ut bene distincte
intelligeret quid campanæ ecclesiæ ei dicerent, et secundum
consilium campanarum ipsa faceret.</p>

<p>“Campanis autem pulsantibus, intellexit juxta voluntatem
suam quod dicerent: ‘Prends ton valet, prends
ton valet.’ Quo accepto, servus egregie verberabit eam,
et fuit ancilla quæ prius erat domina.</p>

<p>“Tunc ad curatum suum conquesta est de consilio,
maledicendo horam quâ crediderat ei. Cui ille: ‘Non
satis audisti quid dicant campanæ.’</p>

<p>“Tunc curatus pulsavit campanas, et tunc intellexit
quod campanæ dicebant: ‘Ne le prends pas, ne le prends
pas.’ Tunc enim vexatio dederat ei intellectum.”</p>

<p>In an Easter sermon, Raulin asks why the news of
the resurrection was announced to women. And he
replies that they have such tongues that they would
spread the news quickest.</p>

<p>He then says that it has been asked why women are
greater chatterboxes than men. And the reason he
gives is certainly original, if perhaps not conclusive.</p>

<p>Man is made of clay, woman of bone—the rib of
Adam. Now if you move a sack of clay, it makes no
noise; but, only touch a bag of bones, and rattle, rattle,
rattle, is what you hear.</p>

<p>This remark is also made by Gratian de Drusac in his
Controverses des Sexes masculin et féminin, 1538, p. 25.</p>

<p>A story told by Raulin, with which I shall conclude,
is not without beauty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>A hermit supplicating God that he might know the
way of safety, beheld the Devil transformed into an
angel of light, who said, “Your prayer is heard, and I
am sent to tell you what you must do to be saved; you
must give God three things united—the new moon, the
disc of the sun, and the head of a rose.” The hermit
was nearly driven to despair, thinking that this was an
impossibility, but a real angel appeared to him, and told
him the solution. “The new moon is a crescent, that is
to say a C; the disc of the sun is an O; and the head
of a rose is R. Unite these three letters, and offer to
God COR, your <i>heart</i>, then the way of salvation is open
before you.”</p>

<h2 id="MEFFRETH">MEFFRETH.</h2>

<p>According to a mediæval legend, an evil spirit once
entered a monastery, passed his novitiate, and became a
full brother. In preaching one Advent to the assembled
friars, he spoke of the terrors of hell, and depicted them
most graphically, being, of course, eminently qualified
for so doing. His discourse produced a profound sensation
among his audience, their blood curdled with
horror, and some of the weaker brethren fainted away.
When the true character of the friar was discovered,
the Superior expressed to him surprise at his want of
judgment in preaching a powerful sermon, calculated to
terrify the hearers from ever venturing on the road
which leads to the place described by the preacher
with such fidelity: but the devil replied with a hideous
sneer, “Think you that my discourse would prevent a
single soul from seeking eternal damnation? Not so;
the most finished eloquence and the profoundest learning
are worthless beside one drop of unction,—<i>there
was no unction in my sermon</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>Meffreth, the subject of this notice, was a preacher of
great popularity in the fifteenth century; his sermons
display great power of a certain order. He was undoubtedly
an accomplished theologian, a good scholar,
and a man of diversified reading; he could speak with
force, and describe with considerable graphic power,—but
for all this, in his two hundred and twenty-five
sermons there is not one in which the unction necessary
for the conversion of souls is to be discovered. It is
quite impossible to read these sermons without feeling
that the preacher’s great object has been the exhibition
of his own ingenuity and learning, not the saving of the
souls of his hearers.</p>

<p>Of the man himself but little is known, and that
little we gain from his own title-page. From it we
ascertain that he was a German priest of Meissen, and
that he flourished about 1443.</p>

<p>His only work is the Hortulus Reginæ, seu Sermones
Dominicales et de Sanctis, per totum annum, in Partes
Æstivalem et Hyemalem distributos. Proderunt Norimbergæ,
1487, fol.; Basileæ, 1488, 2 vols. fol.; Coloniæ,
1645, 4to.; the same sermons, Pars Hiemalis; sine loco
et anno, folio.</p>

<p>Sermones de Præcipuis Sanctorum Festivitatibus;
Monachii, 1614, 4to.; Coloniæ, 1625, 4to.</p>

<p>Meffreth having stated boldly, in his Sermons on the
Conception of the Blessed Virgin, that she was born
with the taint of original sin, his editors were put
to some trouble in order to get a licence to publish;
in the first edition there is an explanatory note by
the publisher, in the second, a long preface by Fr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Joannes de Lapide, a Carthusian and Doctor of the
University of Paris, refuting the opinion of Meffreth
on this head, and stigmatizing it as heresy, not,
however, on Scriptural and Patristic authority, but
on the ground of the judgment of Sixtus IV., the
decision of the University of Paris, and the decree of
the Council of Basle.</p>

<p>The edition of 1625 contains another “Præmonitio
ad lectorem, in tres sequentes sermones de gloriosæ
Virginis Mariæ conceptione,” which, after giving an
account of the indulgence decreed by Sixtus IV. to
all those who should keep the octave of the feast of
the Conception, concludes with these words: “Sixtus
Popa IV. constituit, ut nec affirmantes, nec negantes
Beatam Virginem sine originali peccato conceptam
fuisse, hæreseos, vel peccati mortalis damnarentur,
idque Concil. Trident. sess. 5 de peccato originali
et Pius V. in quadam sua constitutione confirmarunt:
ceterum doctrina dicentium, B. Virginem cum peccato
originali fuisse conceptam, pietati ædificationique populi
minus videtur profutura. Quare quæ per tres sequentes
sermones a Meffreth in hanc sententiam dicuntur, non
sunt pro concione rudibus proponenda, sed Doctorum
disputationi relinquenda: præsertim cum ex iis
quædam admodum incerta et falso quam vero propriora
sunt.”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that a <i>soupçon</i> of heresy might be
supposed to attach to Meffreth by vehement adherents
of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception, the man
is quite extravagant enough in his teaching about Our
Lady to satisfy on all other points the most zealous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Mariolater. For instance, with him, Mary is the garden
of all delights (De Sanctis 3), by her name devils are
put to flight (48), no one can be saved without her
assistance (87 and 95), and she was conceived without
earthly father (17). If Meffreth could swallow so many
camels, he need not have strained at a solitary gnat.
The sermons of Meffreth occupy 1412 pages of small,
close print, in double columns, in the edition of Anthony
Hierat, 1625; and they are furnished with three indices,
one to each of the parts.</p>

<p>They are quite incapable of being reproduced in a
modern pulpit, but they are nevertheless valuable, and
worth the few shillings which they cost, for Meffreth
was a man well versed in the mystical signification of
Scripture, and he has carefully gathered together a vast
amount of serviceable material, though he has been unable
to build it together, with the wood, hay, stubble,
which he has added, into a homogeneous mass.</p>

<p>His sermons open with a fact (?) from natural history,
to which he gives an allegorical interpretation. This
serves as an introduction. The body of the discourse is
separated into two or three parts, and each part contains
several heads; each head is again broken into divisions,
and each division is subdivided. The sermons vary in
length; those for Saints’ days are short, but the rest are
of intolerable length. They are enlivened with anecdotes,
sometimes good, generally pointless, occasionally
absurd.</p>

<p>Those of Meffreth’s sermons which are intended as
expositions of our Lord’s parables are better by far than
the rest, and will be found useful by the theological<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
student. As an example, take the following analysis of
his exhaustive exposition of the parable of the Sower.</p>

<p>He explains it “anagogicè,” “allegoricè,” and “moraliter.”
I shall give only the first two interpretations,
as the moral signification has been given in the Gospel,
and Meffreth does little else than repeat it.</p>

<div class="hanging">

<p>I. Anagogicè—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. God the Father sows seeds of two kinds:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A. Angelic nature, sown in the beginning,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>α. On the way; i. e. on Christ, its true resting-place,
from which some of the angels were
snatched away by pride.</p>

<p>β. On the rock; i. e. on Christ. On this rock
Satan fell and was broken. This is the rock
which at the last day will fall on him and
grind him to powder.</p>

<p>γ. Among thorns; i. e. envy and ambition.</p>

<p>δ. On good ground; this is the angelic
nature, which rested unfallen on the good
ground of God’s presence, and there ripened
into the fruits of love, reverence, and
obedience.</p>

</div>

<p>B. Human nature, sown on the sixth day of
creation. This fell—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>α. On the wayside of luxury: for the woman
saw that the tree was good for food and
pleasant to the eyes.</p>

<p>β. On the rock of pride: for Eve was tempted
by the promise, “Ye shall be as gods.”</p>

<p>γ. Among the thorns of ambition: for the
woman saw that the fruit was good to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
one wise, and she desired “to know good
and evil.”</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>2. God the Son went forth from the bosom of the
Father to sow Himself—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A. In the womb of the ever-blessed Virgin, that
good ground where He would spring up and
bear an hundredfold. In her womb He sowed—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>α. His Divinity.</p>

<p>β. The humanity of Adam’s flesh.</p>

<p>γ. The human soul, which is the breath of
God.</p>

</div>

<p>B. When He left the womb of Mary He went
forth to sow—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>α. The Gospel, which fell—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. On the wayside of the impenitent.</p>

<p>2. On the rock of Pharisaic pride.</p>

<p>3. Among the thorns of worldliness and
avarice.</p>

<p>4. On the good ground of the elect.</p>

</div>

<p>β. That He might sow His Divine grace.</p>

<p>γ. That He might sow His mercy, pardoning
iniquity: and this fell—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. On the wayside of luxury.</p>

<p>2. On the rock of despair.</p>

<p>3. Among the thorns of riches.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>C. His own self did our Lord sow in His double
nature, when He left earth for Heaven, there
to sow the roses of martyrdom, the violets of
confessors, and the lilies of virgins.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>II. Allegoricè—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A. The sower is a preacher of the Gospel. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
seed is the word. The resemblances are sixfold.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>α. The seed attracts the moisture of the earth,
without which it is sterile.</p>

<p>β. The seed occupies the place of weeds.</p>

<p>δ. It contains within itself the principle of life.</p>

the seed, then the blade, then the ear, and
afterward the full corn in the ear.</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the most striking of Meffreth’s sermons,
and one free from his worst defects, is that on
the text, “A certain man made a great supper, and
bade many,” &amp;c.; being part of the Gospel for the
second Sunday after Trinity. It is divided into three
parts, the first two of which I give in abstract, as they
are suggestive and beautiful.</p>

<p>By way of introduction, Meffreth observes that Isidore
in his Natural History asserts that the tiger is a
beast swift as an arrow, marked and dappled with
diverse colours, and when it approaches fire or water,
or a looking-glass, it becomes so sluggish that it either
falls into the fire and is burned, or tumbles into the
water and is drowned, or remains in a brown study in
front of the mirror till the hunters capture it.</p>

<p>Now this has its moral significance, observes the
preacher, for all human beings are tigers, set like
arrows to fly swiftly to their true end and aim, eternal
happiness, which they would reach, were it not for
certain fires and waters and mirrors which retard them,
and allow them to fall into the hands of the devils, who
are the hunters.</p>

<p>Meffreth having proved that man’s true end and aim
is eternal beatitude, shows how that he is checked, and
falls short of his aim, by the fires of evil concupiscence,
the water of impure affections, and the mirrors of worldly
felicity. It will be seen that there is some confusion in
metaphor here.</p>

<p>Meffreth having settled the tigers, approaches the
text.</p>

<p>The supper, he observes, has two significations;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
it is (A), the Blessed Sacrament, and it is (B), the
beatitude of eternal fruition, the one being the earnest
of the other.</p>

<p>And first, with regard to the Blessed Sacrament, he
shows that the name of supper applies well to it for
three reasons—the first being that it was instituted at
the Last Supper; secondly, that <i>cœna</i> is derived from
the Greek κενόν, “<i>new</i>,” and so exhibits it as a sacrament
of the New Testament; and thirdly, because κενόν
signifies <i>shadow</i>, the eucharistic symbols being shadows
of the living realities they contain.</p>

<p>A certain man, in the parable, made a <i>great</i> supper:
a great supper indeed is the Holy Eucharist; great
because of the glorious nature of the food; great because
of the abundance of meats it offers; these meats
being remission of sin, mitigation of carnal desires, a
revivification of good works by the destruction of sins,
a fructification of virtues, an increase in grace, a mystical
ingrafting into Christ, and a pledge of eternal
life. Each of these seven meats is treated of at some
length, and ramifies into collateral subjects. Great,
too, is the supper of the Holy Eucharist, because of its
durability. The feast of Ahasuerus, remarks Meffreth,
lasted but seven days (Esther i.), whereas that of the
Eucharist had lasted 1496 years, that being the date of
his sermon. The preacher then, following St. Ambrose,
shows who are those who come not to the Holy Table;
they are the heathen, the Jews, and the heretics. The
heathen, like him who had bought a piece of land,
have set their affections on this earth, and sold all that
they might secure it. The Jews, ever ploughing with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the five yoke of the Pentateuch, never sow in the seed
of the Word. The heretic, wedded to a sect of his own
choosing, deserts the Catholic Church, which is the
Bride of Christ. None of these men, says our Lord,
shall taste of My supper.</p>

<p>But secondly (B), the supper signifies the beatitude
of celestial glory. The whole of this division is worked
out, I think all will agree, with singular felicity.</p>

<p>A supper, to be really great, says Meffreth, must
have ten properties or requisites:—</p>

<p>1st. It must take place at a suitable time, neither
too early nor too late. That of Ahasuerus was made
in the third year of his reign, and that of Christ in
the third age, the age of grace.</p>

<p>2nd. It must take place in a spacious, and suitable,
and secure spot. That of Ahasuerus was made “in
the court of the garden of the king’s palace: where
were white, green, and blue hangings, fastened with
cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and
pillars of marble.” And the preacher shows how
that the place of the heavenly banquet excels that
of Sushan in spaciousness, suitability, and security.</p>

<p>3rd. There must be great liberality and hilarity of
the host. Of Ahasuerus it is said, “The heart of
the king was merry with wine, and he commanded—to
bring Vashti the queen before the king with the
crown royal, to show the people and the princes her
beauty: for she was fair to look on.” Christ also shows
His liberality and hilarity by making His feast known
to all; by the greatness of His preparation; by His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
inviting many; by His distress at the refusal of those
first invited, and His sending into the streets and lanes
of the city; by His compelling men to come in from the
highways and hedges.</p>

<p>The fourth requisite of a great supper is the abundance
and the variety of the dishes. King Ahasuerus
gave drink “in vessels of gold (the vessels being
diverse one from another), and royal wine in abundance,
according to the state of the king.” In like
manner has Christ prepared abundance of good things
for His marriage supper. And chief among these are
the twelve refections of the just, each of which Meffreth
comments upon with great beauty. I can but name
them.</p>

<p>1. Health without infirmity. (Ps. ciii. 3. Isa.
lx. 18.)</p>

<p>2. Youth without age. (Ps. ciii. 5.) This is followed
by a dissertation on the apparent age which the
resurrection body will have.</p>

<p>3. Satiety without distaste. (Isa. xlix. 10. Eccles.
i. 8.) Followed by a proof that the soul can be satisfied
with nothing short of God.</p>

<p>4. Beauty without deformity. (Matt. xiii. 43. Wisd.
iii. 7.) Followed by a dissertation on the degrees of
glory hereafter.</p>

<p>5. Impassibility with immortality. (Isa. xxv. 8;
xlix. 10.)</p>

<p>6. Abundance without want; to this the preacher
applies very beautifully the text, Judges xviii. 10.</p>

<p>7. Peace without break.</p>

<p>8. Safety without fear. (Ps. cxlvii. 14.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>9. Knowledge without ignorance. (1 Cor. xiii. 12.)</p>

<p>10. Glory without shame. (Col. iii. 4.)</p>

<p>11. Joy without sadness: joy in having overcome
our foes, joy in having become purged from every
defect, joy in having escaped the woes of the
lost.</p>

<p>12. Liberty without restraint, arising from the
spirituality of the body. To will being then to
do: the spiritual body being capable of travelling
as swiftly as mind, of executing whatever the imagination
can conceive.</p>

<p>Each Person of the ever-blessed Trinity, observes
Meffreth, will grant us three gifts.</p>

<p>God the Father will present us with the unutterable
contemplation of His unveiled presence, with the entire
possession of all good things, and with the fulfilment of
every desire.</p>

<p>God the Son will afford us clean and renewed flesh,
sanctified souls radiant with beauty, and participation
in the Divine nature.</p>

<p>God the Holy Ghost will give us the sweetness of
eternal fruition, the wine of perennial gladness, and the
fruits of love, joy, peace, &amp;c. (Gal. v. 22, 23.)</p>

<p>Meffreth then returning to the requisites of a feast,
says that the fifth is the courtesy of the ministers. In
that made by King Ahasuerus, it is expressly said, “The
king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that
they should do according to every man’s pleasure.”
How fully will that requisite be obtained in the
heavenly banquet! exclaims Meffreth, when even Christ
“shall gird Himself and make” His servants “sit down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
to meat, and will come forth and serve them.” (Luke
xii. 37.)</p>

<p>The sixth requisite of a feast is sweet music, and here
Meffreth speaks of the music of the heavenly city as
heard by St. John in Patmos.</p>

<p>The seventh requisite is abundance of light, and on
this he quotes the Apocalypse xxi. 23, “And the city
had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in
it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is
the light thereof.”</p>

<p>The eighth requisite is the delicacy of the victuals,
and this he applies to the varied delights the redeemed
will have in the society of the saints and of the angels
in their differing orders and ranks.</p>

<p>The ninth requisite is duration. The banquet of
Ahasuerus lasted but seven days, whilst that of Christ
will be for ever and ever.</p>

<p>And lastly, a feast must be peaceful and calm. When
Ahasuerus made his banquet, he prepared “beds of gold
and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white,
and black marble.” How much sweeter will be the
rest of the redeemed in the green pastures of Paradise,
beside the ever-flowing waters of comfort!</p>

<p>In another sermon on the same Gospel, Meffreth
strangely inverts the subject just given, and makes
the certain man to be the devil, and he describes with
equal power the great feast of emptiness which he prepares.
The properties of a feast are of course in this
case wanting in every particular. For abundance of
light there is outer darkness; for sweetness of music
there are never-ending cries of despair; for calm and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
tranquillity there is strife and discord, and instead of
those who are at that fearful feast having delicacy or
variety of food, they are themselves the food on which
the never-dying worm so sweetly feeds.</p>

<p>The commencement of the second sermon for the
same Sunday after Trinity is so thoroughly characteristic
of Meffreth’s worst style, that I must give it in his
own Latin.</p>

<p>“Experientia, quæ est rerum magistra,”—note this
pompous and stately beginning, and see what it introduces—“sæpe
ostendit, quod mus, quandoque intrat
promptuarium macilentus, ibique invenit lardum, carnes
vel caseum et hujusmodi (and all that sort of thing)
comedit, et impinguatur, cumque dominus venit quærens
murem, vult fugere per foramen arctum, per quod
intravit, sed præ pinguetudine non potest exire, sicque
capitur et necatur.</p>

<p>“Moraliter. Per mures hic ad præsens intelliguntur
homines, quia, sicut mus ab humo dicitur, eo quod ex
humore terræ nascatur. Nam humus terra dicitur. Sic
enim homo ab humo est dictus, eo quod <i>de limo terræ est
formatus</i>. Gen. i.” After a few words about minding
earthly things, and a quotation from Boetius, he continues,—“Si
enim inter mures videres unum aliquem,
jus sibi atque potestatem præ cæteris vendicantem, id
est, usurpantem super alios mures. O quanto movereris
cachinno, id est, risu, quia derisibile esset, et talis potestas
terrena scilicet derisibilis, quæ non extendit se ad
corpus. Quid vero si tu corpus spectes hominis, quid
est imbecillius, id est, debilius homine? quasi diceret,
nihil; quos scilicet homines muscarum sæpeque morsus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
in secreta, id est;”—another id est, Meffreth is intent
upon being intelligible,—“in interiora hominis quæque
reptantium, id est, serpentium, necat introitus.” The
construction of this sentence is very confused. “In quo
declarat, quod homo est mure debilior, imo parvissimo
mure, quia musculus est diminutivum a mure. Iste
quidem homo ad instar muris macilentus et nudus intrat
in promptuarium hujus mundi. Juxta illud Job i.
<i>Nudus ingressus sum in hunc mundum et nudus revertar
illuc.</i> Cui alludet Apost., 1 Tim. vi., <i>Nihil intulimus in
hunc mundum, haud</i>, id est, non <i>dubium, quia nec auferre
quid possumus</i>.”</p>

<p>Having brought us into the larder of this world,
Meffreth ought to have followed out the moral application,
but he becomes apparently lost over the “lardum,
carnes vel caseum et hujusmodi,” and never leaves them
throughout his sermon.</p>

<p>An Advent discourse opens with the following statement:
“Naturalists say that the Balustia, a certain
flower of the pomegranate, is cold and dry, and has
astringent and stiptic properties, wherefore it is used
against dysentery and bloody flux of the stomach. It
also restrains choleric vomiting, if it be cooked in vinegar
and laid upon the collar-bone—so say medical
men.”</p>

<p>“Expert naturalists say that every irrational animal,
when it feels itself becoming weak and helpless, at once
seeks a remedy for its languor, which may restore it to
health.… In like manner, says Isidorus (lib. xii.),
stags, when they feel themselves burdened with infirmity,
snuff the serpents from their holes with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
breath of their nostrils, and having overcome the
noxiousness of the poison, reinvigorate themselves with
their food. Aristotle (lib. vi.) says of animals, that
bears are wont to eat crabs and ants for medicinal
purposes. Avicenna relates in his book viii. of animals,
that it was related to him by a faithful old
man, that he had seen two little birds squabbling, and
that one was overcome; it therefore retired and ate of
a certain herb, then it returned to the onslaught;
which, when the old man observed frequently, he took
away the herb. Now when the birdie came back and
found it not, it set up a great cry and died. And
Avicenna says, ‘I inquired the name of the plant, and
conjectured it to be of the species which is called
<i>Lactua agrestis</i>.’” (Dom. Sexagesima i.)</p>

<p>“The owl at night eats the eggs of the jackdaw,
because it is strongest by night. But, on the other
hand, the jackdaw walks off with the owl’s eggs by
day, and eats them, because the owl is feeble by day.
In like manner the devil devours all man’s good works
in the night of sin, … and just as the devil like an
owl destroys man’s good works by mortal sins, so on
the other hand ought man in the day of safety and
grace to destroy the devil’s eggs by works of repentance.”
(Feria, 4to. post, Reminiscere i.)</p>

<p>“According to naturalists, salt has the property of
preserving from putrefaction. For we see that if meat
is placed at full moon in the beams of the moon, it
breeds worms, because the moon augments the moisture
of the meat, and by this means predisposes it for corruption.
If, however, meat is salted, the moon cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
do it so much harm; for salt extracts from the flesh its
juices, wherefore men desirous of preserving meat from
putrefaction put it in the pickle-tub. Morally—by
salt understand the bitterness of penitence, or satisfaction;
and by the meat understand carnal delights,” &amp;c.
(Domin. 2da p. Pascha, 9.)</p>

<p>I have mentioned the fact of Meffreth using stories
in his sermons. They occur very frequently; they are
not all either appropriate or edifying. The following,
however, is pretty: it is to be found in the first sermon
on the parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus. Meffreth
is speaking of wealth and its cares as contrasted with
the <i>insouciance</i> of poverty. He then relates the story
of a certain Robin, or Rubinus, a poor man who lived
under the steps leading into the palace of a wealthy
nobleman. Poor Robin had a hard time of it: he toiled
all day, and at nightfall he would go about the streets
with an old fiddle, playing for a few coppers: sometimes,
however, he would get as much as five pence,
and then he would fiddle and sing at night on his straw,
so cheerily that the rich man in his palace heard him
and sighed, because his own heart was never glad. One
day the lady of the house said to her lord, “How is it
that you with all your wealth are never happy, whilst
poor Robin under our stairs is as cheerful as a cricket?”
“I will destroy his mirth,” replied the rich man; and
he secretly conveyed a bag of money into Robin’s den.</p>

<p>No fiddle, no song, were heard for many days, for the
poor fellow was gloating over his strangely-acquired
wealth, and fearing hourly lest it should be taken from
him. “How is it,” asked the lady of the house, “how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
is it that Robin neither fiddles, whistles, nor sings now?”
“Mark!” replied her lord; “I will restore his song to
him.” So he reclaimed his money. Now when Robin
was free of this source of care, he caught up his fiddle
and sang to it right lustily half the night through.</p>

<p>Another charming story told by Meffreth is this:—</p>

<p>There was once an aged hermit in the Egyptian desert,
who thought it would be well with him if he had an olive-tree
near his cave. So he planted a little tree, and thinking
it might want water, he prayed to God for rain, so rain
came and watered his olive-tree. Then he thought that
some warm sun to swell its buds would be advisable,
so he prayed, and the sun shone out. Now the nursling
looked feeble, and the old man deemed it would be
well for the tree if frost were to come and brace it. He
prayed for the frost, and hoar frost settled that night on
bar and beam. Next, he believed a hot southerly wind
would suit his tree, and after prayer the south wind
blew upon his olive-tree and—it died. Some little
while after, the hermit visited a brother hermit, and lo!
by his cell-door stood a flourishing olive-tree. “How
came that goodly plant there, brother?” asked the unsuccessful
hermit.</p>

<p>“I planted it, and God blessed it, and it grew.”</p>

<p>“Ah! brother, I too planted an olive, and when I
thought it wanted water I asked God to give it rain, and
the rain came; and when I thought it wanted sun, I asked,
and the sun shone; and when I deemed that it needed
strengthening, I prayed, and frost came—God gave me
all I demanded for my tree as I saw fit, yet is it dead.”</p>

<p>“And I, brother,” replied the other hermit, “I left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
my tree in God’s hands, for He knew what it wanted
better than I.”</p>

<p>Very different is Meffreth’s story of the fat priest who
was carving a capon in Lent, when his servant burst
out laughing behind his back. “Sirrah! what are you
laughing at?” asked the globular parson.</p>

<p>“Oh, your reverence! excuse me, but I could not
help thinking what a lot of drippings there would be
from you, when hereafter the devils have the roasting
of you.”</p>

<h2 id="MATTHIAS_FABER">MATTHIAS FABER.</h2>

<p>Matthias Faber was born at Neumarkt, in Bavaria, in
the year 1586. He was appointed to the cure of the
parish of St. Maurice in Ingolstadt, and to the professorship
of the University in that town. Whilst there,
he published three volumes of sermons for every Sunday
in the year, and these have gone through six editions.</p>

<p>He was much regarded as a preacher, and deservedly
so, for he was a man full of learning and genius, though
not remarkable for his eloquence.</p>

<p>In the year 1637, at the age of fifty-one, he was received
into the Society of Jesus at Vienna, and continued
after his reception to preach with considerable success.
He then published another volume of sermons for all the
Sundays and the principal festivals of the year. This
book, divided into two parts, is called the Auctuarium,
and was thenceforward published along with the former
volumes. The Concionum opus tripartitum, together
with the Auctuarium, contain one thousand and ninety-six
sermons. Besides these, he preached funeral and
marriage orations, published after his death, which took
place on the 26th of April, 1653, at Tyrnau.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not to be expected that in such a vast collection
all should be of equal merit; and yet few of Faber’s
sermons would be put down as bad. The vast majority
of them are remarkably good, and full of matter. Not
one, perhaps, could be found which does not contain
more suggestive remarks than we are accustomed to
hear from the modern pulpit in a month. Faber is
brief, but what he says he has thought well over, and it
is always worth the hearing. He is almost too brief
sometimes, for he throws out a brilliant remark, and
goes on to another without making the most—without,
indeed, making any thing of the former.</p>

<p>How great is the contrast between him and a modern
preacher, who every Sunday labours through a polished
and carefully worded essay, containing in many words
the feeblest whiff of an idea! And Faber could vary
his matter to suit his hearers. Preaching before his
University, he discussed learned questions in Divinity
with great lucidity; but preaching to the good citizens
of Ingolstadt, he confined himself to practical instructions.</p>

<p>His style is dignified and earnest, but it is not
eloquent, though many of the passages in his sermons
are very graceful. And he is perfectly free from the
bombast which supplied the place of eloquence among
certain preachers of his day.</p>

<p>Matthias Faber does not shrink from telling a story,
and a story with a good practical moral to it, but he
does not attempt simile to any extent.</p>

<p>There is an apparent crudity in his discourses. Probably
this is owing to their being printed from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
abstract which he drew up before preaching; so that
when delivered, the apparent abruptness and ruggedness
of this outline may have been smoothed away.</p>

<p>Few ancient preachers would be more serviceable to a
clergyman of the present day, or more acceptable to an
English congregation. Unfortunately, the volumes are
somewhat scarce, and consequently expensive.</p>

<p class="sermon center">Fourth Sunday in Lent.</p>

<p>St. John vi. 13. “They gathered them together, and
filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five
barley loaves.”</p>

<p>Introduction.</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>There were twelve baskets full of food gathered
from this feast which Jesus made in the wilderness,
and twelve are the wholesome lessons
which I gather from it, and with which I feed
you to-day.</p>

<p>1. Learn fervour and zeal for hearing the Gospel.</p>

<p class="not">“The people,” we are told, “ran afoot out of
all cities, and outwent them, and came together
unto Him.” Behold their earnestness,
and contrast it with your indifference. They
came on foot, they came long distances, they
came in great numbers, they outwent Christ
and His Apostles, they came voluntarily and
without having been summoned, they came
oblivious of their bodily wants, bringing with
them their wives and children. Faber draws
a contrast between these people and his hearers,
undoubtedly just, but certainly not flattering:
and he applies to the latter the words of God
to Ezekiel, “Ye pollute Me among My people
for handfuls of barley, and for pieces of
bread.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>2. Learn the various effects produced by God’s
Word on different hearers.</p>

<p class="not">Faber is singularly infelicitous in filling this
basket. He observes that our Lord at one time
drew near to the sea, but did not enter it; at
another put off a little from land, but soon
returned to it, and now in to-day’s Gospel
crosses the sea, and having crossed it, performs
the miracle: so does He shadow forth three
kinds of Christians in His mystical Body, the
Church: those who only approach the bitter
sea of repentance, those who just enter it and
again return to land, and those who traverse
it and are found meet to sit down in green
pastures at His heavenly banquet.</p>

<p>3. Learn the custody of the eyes.</p>

<p class="not">Christ “lifted up His eyes” and beheld the
multitude. He had them before on earth, not
straying hither and thither; and so He
teaches us to restrain our wandering gaze.
His eyes meekly rested on earth; Eve’s, straying
among the boughs, saw the fruit of the
tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and
those wandering eyes brought death into this
world. So did the restless eyes of Potiphar’s
wife light on Joseph, so did the unguarded eyes
of David fall on Bathsheba, and the curious
eyes of the two elders on Susanna. But we are
not required to keep our eyes always fixed on
earth, or closed; but to restrain them from
idle curiosity, to avert them from dangerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
objects, and to guard them carefully when we
pray. There are, on the other hand, times
when we should raise them, after the example
of Christ. For the considering and relieving
of the poor (John vi. 5), in giving thanks
(Mark vi. 41), in praying (John xvii. 1),
in giving instruction (Luke vi. 20), in
seeking the glory of God in all our actions
(John xi. 41).</p>

<p>4. Learn to ask God’s blessing on your food.</p>

<p class="not">As Christ gave thanks, and looking up to
Heaven blessed the loaves and fishes.</p>

<p class="not">We have the same lesson in Deut. viii. 10,
“When thou hast eaten and art full, then
thou shalt bless the Lord thy God.” And
we have the example of the Israelites who
would not eat of the victims till Samuel had
blessed them.</p>

<p>5. Learn care for the poor.</p>

<p class="not">Christ gave the loaves and fishes to His disciples
to distribute among the multitude, and
so He gives the rich their abundance, not for
them to consume it themselves, but that they
may “distribute and give to the poor.”</p>

<p>6. Learn to see God’s providence in the support of
all men, and especially of His own servants.</p>

<p class="not">Thus did God provide manna for the Israelites
in the wilderness (Exod. xvi. 12), bread and
meat for Elijah during the famine (1 Kings
xvii. 4), food for Daniel in the lions’ den
(Bel and Dragon, 33).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>7. Learn to seek the food of the soul before seeking
that of the body.</p>

<p class="not">Thus Christ before feeding the multitude
“spake unto them of the kingdom of God”
(Luke), “began to teach them many things”
(Mark).</p>

<p>8. Learn that fasting precedes festival, Lent goes
before Easter.</p>

<p class="not">So now Christ retired to the wilderness, as
“the Jews’ passover was nigh at hand; and
many went out of the country up to Jerusalem
before the passover, to purify themselves”
(John xi. 55.)</p>

<p>9. Learn moderation and frugality in diet.</p>

<p class="not">Christ performed the miracle of feeding five
thousand, not with luxuries, but with plain and
wholesome food, to teach us not to care about
luxurious living, but to be content with simple
diet.</p>

<p>10. Learn that there should be order in the Church.</p>

<p class="not">For the people sat not down till commanded,
and then, not in confusion, but in ranks.</p>

<p>11. Learn to avoid waste, and what is superfluous
learn to give to the poor.</p>

<p class="not">This may be gathered from the fragments
being collected by the Apostles at Christ’s
express command.</p>

<p>12. Learn to despise worldly honours.</p>

<p class="not">For when the multitude would have taken
Jesus by force, and made Him a king—as we
read in to-day’s Gospel—He fled from them
into a high mountain apart.</p>

instruction be satisfied, and, thanking God,
acknowledge Christ for their true king.</p>

<p>Introduction.</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>In God’s Word we find rules of life for all conditions
of men, for all stages of life, for all
positions in society. The Gospel for this day
gives instruction to several grades of men.</p>

<p>1. Parents are taught:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>α. To train their children in the fear and admonition
of the Lord. To bring them at an
early age to the house of God, to teach them
to love its courts, to take pleasure in its services,
and to delight in the instructions given
there.</p>

<p>β. To seek their children when they wander
from the paths of righteousness, to seek them
sorrowing, and to find no rest till they see
them restored.</p>

<p>α. To follow God rather than man; to obey Him
in preference to their earthly parents, remembering
that “He who loveth father or mother
more than Me, is not worthy of Me.”</p>

<p>β. But in every thing else, except where the will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
of parents clashes with the will of God, cheerfully
to submit to them.</p>

</div>

<p>3. Married persons are taught to feel for each other,
and to sympathize with each other. Thus
Joseph entered into the grief of Mary at the
loss of her Son, and returned with her to Jerusalem
in quest of Him. And Mary showed
deference to her husband, saying, “Thy father
and I have sought Thee sorrowing,” placing
Joseph in honour before herself.</p>

<p>4. Kinsfolk and acquaintance are taught that they
have a responsibility in the children of their
relatives. Mary and Joseph sought Jesus
among them. So God required Abel at the
hand of Cain. So the Apostle writes to
Timothy, “If any man provide not for his
own (i. e. look not after his own), and specially
for those of his own house, he hath denied the
faith, and is worse than an infidel.”</p>

<p>5. Priests are taught to abide in the temple, and to
be ready to hear the doubts and perplexities of
others, and to answer them as God gives them
understanding.</p>

<p>6. Finally, all may learn—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>α. From the fact of Joseph and Mary coming to
Jerusalem, notwithstanding that Archelaus did
still reign there, and leaving their substance
and business for the service of God—that we
should not allow vain excuses to hinder us
from attending public worship.</p>

<p>β. From the fact of Christ the Eternal Wisdom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
deigning to listen humbly to these blind
Pharisees and ignorant doctors—that we
should not puff ourselves up with the consideration
that we know better than those whom
God has appointed over us as teachers, but in
lowliness hearken to their instructions.</p>

<p>γ. From the fact of Mary, Joseph, and Jesus
accomplishing the days, and not leaving before
the feast was over—that we should not be
eager to rush out of church in the middle of
service, in the midst of the celebration of the
Blessed Sacrament, before the completion of
the sacrifice.</p>

<p>δ. From the fact of Mary and Joseph going to
Jerusalem, “according to the custom of the
feast,”—we learn to submit to all laudable
customs, and not to set ourselves against them
on the plea of our superior wisdom or understanding.</p>

<p>ε. From the fact of Mary and Jesus going to
Jerusalem, whereas the law was not binding
upon women and children—we learn not to rest
satisfied with the letter, but to go on to the
spirit; not to be content with mere conformity
to the bare commandment of God, but with
loving hearts to strive to “do more for His
sake than of bounden duty is required.” (The
Church, for instance, bids us communicate
three times in the year, but let us draw near
oftener to the altar of God. The law of God
requires us to give tithes of our goods, but let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
us give more, be liberal-hearted, and liberal-handed,
and glad to distribute. S. B. G.)</p>

<p>ζ. From the fact of Christ being said to have
increased in favour with God and man—let us
learn to seek first the favour of God, and then
the favour of good men will be added to us.
Those who seek first the favour of men, often
lose both that of man and God. Pilate, to
find favour with Cæsar, fearing the accusation,
“Thou art not Cæsar’s friend,” gave up
Christ. And what did he gain? Nothing;
he lost the favour of God and of Cæsar. By
the one he was driven into exile, by the other
he was cast down into hell.</p>

<p>Conclusion.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I will add a few specimens of the style of Matthias
Faber. And I shall quote first some portions of an
Easter sermon.</p>

<p>“See how our hope and confidence should be fixed on
God. For the women went to the sepulchre through
the morning twilight, without thought of the soldiers
who guarded it, or of the sepulchral stone which closed
it, for removing which they were far too weak. But as
they drew nigh they considered this difficulty among
themselves, saying, ‘Who shall roll us away the stone
from the door of the sepulchre?’ And yet they
turned not back despondingly, but resolutely persevered,
trusting in God to provide the way and means.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
And so it was as they trusted: by the providence of
God the stone was removed by an angel, and at the
sight of the angel the keepers fled in fear. Where
human aid is wanting, there, if we trust in God, Divine
aid is present.”</p>

<p>“Behold the place, where we can see an image of the
beatitude which we may expect on the Resurrection
day. We see it in the angel. For he appeared as ‘a
young man,’ and we all shall arise in ‘the measure of
the stature of the fulness of Christ,’ in the flower of
youth. His countenance was like lightning, and the
bodies of the blessed shall be resplendent as the sun.
He was vested in ‘raiment white as snow,’ signifying
the glory and beatitude of the soul; ‘And white robes
were given unto every one of them’ (Rev. vi. 11), those
white robes which are promised to him that overcometh
(Rev. iii. 5). He sat upon the stone—image of the
constant and perpetual rest, ay, and regal dignity of
the blessed in Heaven. And lastly, the angel was
‘sitting on the right side,’ for in Heaven there is
nothing sinister and adverse, but all right, prosperous,
and happy. But of this I have said enough elsewhere.”</p>

<p>The following are from a Palm Sunday discourse:—</p>

<p>“Processions are in use in the Church on this day
with palm-branches, in imitation of that in which
Christ our Lord was this day conducted by the crowd
and His disciples to the city of Jerusalem. But our
Jerusalem is in Heaven, and thither are we advancing,
led by Christ. With Him, and by Him, must we enter
<i>the vision of peace</i> which Jerusalem signifies. In this
procession he who takes not part, enters not Heaven.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
For the idle and the spectators have no admission
there. All those who took part in that triumphal
entry into Jerusalem had something to do. Some
loosed and led up the ass and colt, some laid their
garments on them, some set Jesus thereon, some spread
the public road with garments, some cut down branches
from the trees, others again sang; the very beasts fulfilled
their office, and bore their Creator. In like manner
must we do something for Christ, if we would become
partakers of His glory.”</p>

<p>After having applied these several acts of the multitude
to various conditions of life, in a practical manner,
he comes to the seventh, “Others cried, saying, Hosanna
to the Son of David,” which he explains thus, “This do
those who are happy and well-to-do in this present life,
who are tossed by no storms of adversity, but sail on a
tranquil sea. But there is danger in a life so calm in
its state of wealth and pleasure. Yet they who have
it, may also enter into the Blessed City, if they refer
those good things which they enjoy to God, and diligently
thank Him for them, ‘singing and making melody in’
their ‘hearts to the Lord; giving thanks always for all
things unto God and the Father in the name of our
Lord Jesus Christ.’ (Eph. v. 19, 20.) In like manner
the state of felicity in which they were created was not
injurious to the holy angels, for directly they were
created they began to sing praises and give thanks to
God for the benefit they had received, as God testified
to Job, ‘The morning stars sang together, and all the
sons of God shouted for joy.’ (Job xxxviii. 7.) And
by reason of this praise, they were confirmed in a state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
of grace and felicity, and received glory. For this
cause the holy patriarchs, though they abounded in
earthly possessions, yet lost not their salvation. For
indeed, they referred all their fortune, their prosperity,
their abundance, to God. Thus Noah, saved from the
deluge, ‘builded an altar unto the Lord;’ thus Abraham,
having received a promise of the land for a possession,
‘built an altar unto the Lord.’ Thus did Isaac when
he received the promise of the seed; thus did Jacob
when delivered from the fear of Esau; thus, too, in
acknowledgment of the good things they acquired,
they called these things gifts of God; as Joseph called
his sons, and as Jacob his sons and his flocks.</p>

<p>“If those who sail in prosperity, would but imitate
these, and sing praises to God, they would reach the
port of safety without difficulty.”</p>

<p>I have said that Faber did not excel in simile. I
must instance a few of his attempts at illustration of
this nature, to corroborate my statement.</p>

<p>In one sermon, already quoted, he speaks of persons
who begin repentance, and then soon break off from
their pious exercises, to return to their old state of
torpor and indifference, and he says they resemble
frogs, which crawl a little way out of their swamp,
but, at the least sound to alarm them, flop into their
slough again.</p>

<p>In another sermon, Faber rebukes those who ask
thoughtlessly in prayer, and make no use of the
blessings given them in answer, and he tells them
they are like the boys who on bonfire night go about
begging wood with the song,—</p>

</div>

<p>And what use do they make of the faggot when they
have it? asks the preacher. Why they make a fire
with it, on which they may jump, till they have
stamped it out!</p>

<p>And in speaking of the obedience of servants to their
masters, he says it should resemble that of the man who
is being shaved. Such a man turns his head this way, or
that way, puts his chin up, or puts it down, in obedience
to the slightest gesture and sign of the barber.</p>

<p>Faber is fond of quoting popular sayings and proverbs;
some of which I give in his quaint old German:—</p>

<p>This is in reference to St. Katharine’s day closing
the door of the Christian year.</p>

<p>I must find space for one story related by Faber on
New Year’s Day.</p>

<p>A farmer once told a wise man that he was daily
becoming poorer; whereupon he received from the
wise man a casket, with the advice to take it daily into
his kitchen, his garden, his storehouse, his vineyard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
his cellar, his stable, and his field; and then, on the
condition that the box was not opened till the year’s end,
the sage promised wealth to the farmer. The husbandman
obeyed implicitly: in the kitchen he found the cook
wasting the meat, in the cellar the vats leaking, in the
fields the labourers idling, in the garden the vegetables
unhoed. All these disorders were rectified, and by the
year’s end the man’s fortune was doubled. Then he
opened the casket, and found in it a slip of paper, on
which was written:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">“Wills du Dag dir reichlich geling</div>
<div class="verse">Solves taglich zu deinem Ding.”</div>

<h2 id="PHILIP_VON_HARTUNG">PHILIP VON HARTUNG.</h2>

<p>This very popular preacher was horn on the 25th
October, 1629, at Theising, in Bohemia. He entered
the novitiate of the Jesuit order in 1645, at the age of
sixteen. He spent his early life in different colleges,
but finally he ascertained that his vocation was to be a
preacher, and thenceforth he devoted his time and energies
to the composition of sermons. He preached most
frequently at Sternberg, in Moravia, and at Glogau, in
Silesia. He died at Eger on the 9th March, 1682,
aged fifty-three. The greater part of his works were
published after his decease.</p>

<p>1. R. P. Philippi Hartung, Concio tergemina rustica,

<p>The sermons of Philip von Hartung are very unequal;
some of them are polished gems, others are very rough
diamonds; but none are without value. The preacher
had his mind stored with matter, but he was wanting
in the art of nicely digesting it, and reproducing what
fermented in his brain, in a pleasant form. At least, so
we must judge of him from his published Latin sermons;
but it is quite open to question whether these
discourses were delivered as they are written. I am
rather inclined to regard them as his schemes from
which he preached, the outlines which he developed
extempore. And this I think the more probable, as the
vast majority are short. It must be remembered that
only one edition of the sermons appeared during the
author’s lifetime, and that, only two years before his
death. In this edition are contained the Sunday sermons,
but not those for the festivals.</p>

<p>Hartung gives at least three sermons for each Sunday
and festival: one addressed to a rural congregation, the
second to a town audience, and the third delivered before
Court. As might be expected, the <i>concio aulica</i> is the
poorest of the set, the preacher being less at his ease,
and more fettered by conventionalities. The rustic
sermons are capital. He preaches on broad facts of
religion, Sunday after Sunday, with striking vigour,
considerable beauty, and no small amount of originality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>During the Sundays in Advent he preaches to the
rural congregation on the Last Judgment. The first
sermon is on the appearance in Heaven of the cross, the
sign of the Son of Man; the second is on the trumpet-call
waking the dead; the third on the examination of
the risen ones; the fourth on the final dooms of good
and bad; each of these is a most striking sermon.</p>

<p>From the first Sunday after the Epiphany to Quinquagesima,
Hartung preaches on Hell: the absence of Jesus,
its chief woe, the hunger and thirst of the damned,
the gloom, the tears, the horror of the abode, the undying
worm of conscience, the fire, the eternity of the
punishment, the murmurs of the damned, &amp;c.</p>

<p>From the first Sunday in Lent to Palm Sunday he
preaches on Death: the time of death the season of
temptation, the time of death the moment of transfiguration,
the time of death the time for confession and
communion, the time of death the moment of supreme
joy, &amp;c.</p>

<p>At the same time he has another series of rural sermons
from Septuagesima to the close of Lent, on our
Lord’s Passion.</p>

<p>From Easter Day, Hartung preaches upon Heaven:
the beauty of the glorified body fills three discourses;
he speaks then of the harmony of Heaven, the immutability
of the joy, the vastness and beauty of the abode
of the redeemed, the delight of the five senses in
Heaven, and the thoughts of Heaven.</p>

<p>Throughout Trinity, Hartung preaches upon God.
I shall give two sermons of the preacher, the one on
Hell, the other on Heaven.</p>

<p>He loses more who loses the favour of a king, and
the love of an intimate friend, as did Absalom.</p>

<p>He loses more yet who loses himself, as did Ahithophel.</p>

<p>But he loses most who loses Jesus; for he who loses
Jesus loses every thing, a treasure above price, the best
of friends, the surest of counsellors, his <i>all in all</i>.</p>

<p>The names Jesus and Jehovah are very similar, as
St. Jerome observes, for what Jehovah <i>signifies</i>, that
Jesus <i>is</i>—all in all. Oh! how sweetly does Ambrose
exclaim, “Christ is our all.”</p>

<p>Art thou an infant? He is thy mother, her breast,
her milk.</p>

<p>Art thou aged? He is thy staff, thy stay.</p>

<p>Art thou a boy? He is thy path, thy way.</p>

<p>Art thou sick? He is thy physician and thy medicine.</p>

<p>Art thou dying? He buries thy soul, not in the
bosom of Abraham, but in His own pierced side, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
thy body He lays in the field which He purchased for
thee at the price of His blood, the field of the Church,
His Bride.</p>

<p>Christ is all to us. He who loses Him, loses all.
Truly, if Micah could say when his idols were removed,
<i>Ye have taken away my gods which I made,—and what
have I more?</i> (Judg. xviii. 24;) far more truly may he
complain who sees himself deprived of Jesus.</p>

<p>And this will be the chief woe of the damned—that
Jesus is irrevocably lost to them. For if He were in
hell, it would be no hell, as Heaven without Him would
be no Heaven, as the Royal Psalmist exclaims: <i>Whom
have I in Heaven but Thee?</i> To be with Jesus, is to be
in Paradise, as the poor thief learned, when he was
assured that he should be with Jesus, and therefore be
in Paradise: <i>To-day shalt thou be with Me in Paradise</i>.</p>

<p>To be away from Jesus is to be in hell. Wherefore
the sentence of the Judge is: <i>Depart from Me, ye
cursed</i>. To be separated from Jesus, and that for ever;
ah! that is <i>the</i> malediction of all, that a hell deeper
than hell itself.</p>

<p>But how is it that we esteem this loss at so small a
price? that we lose Jesus knowingly, wilfully, for a
momentary pleasure, for a point of honour, for a nothing
at all; and having lost Him, seek Him not sorrowing?</p>

<p>Our own gross ignorance is the cause, readily consenting
to sin, and so losing us the dear presence of
Jesus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>2. How great this loss is, and how great a grief
arises from this loss, those who have experienced the
loss know.</p>

<p>Mary Magdalene saw her beloved Jesus fall seven
times beneath the great weight of the cross, she beheld
Him hang for three hours upon the cross, she saw Him
taken down from the tree and laid in a sepulchre, and
yet not one Evangelist says that she shed a single tear.
But on the most festive day of the Resurrection, when
the angels sang their paschal hallelujah in full choir,
when mourning was laid aside for garments white and
clean, when the dead themselves rose for joy from their
graves, and the dawn blushed a fairer pink than heretofore,
and the sun, rejoicing <i>as a giant to run his course</i>,
scattered brighter than wonted beams, <span class="smcapuc">THEN</span> Magdalene
wept inconsolably, nor deigned to look at the angels
who asked, <i>Woman, why weepest thou? for</i>, says the
Evangelist, she had <i>bowed down</i> her face to the earth,
as though beaten down and crushed beneath the burden
of her sorrow.</p>

<p>But why this strange paradox! that she should not
weep at the time for tears, and now not laugh at the
time for laughter? Magdalene’s answer explains all:
<i>They have taken away my Lord</i>. This was her sole and
worthy cause of tears—the absence of her Lord. “She
wept more,” says Augustine, “because He was removed
from the sepulchre, than because He was slain upon the
tree.” When He was on the cross, she stood by; when
He was entombed, she sat over against the sepulchre;
dying she was near Him, risen she was parted from
Him—therefore flowed her tears. Truly may St. Bernard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
say: “So sweet is Jesus to all who taste of Him,
so beautiful to all who behold Him, so dear to all who
embrace Him, that a little moment of absence is greatest
cause of sorrow.” But oh! what will it then be, to lose
Him for ever and ever!</p>

<p>3. To this example of a female disciple who loved
much, let us add that of a male disciple who loved very
much, that from both we may learn what it is to lose
Jesus. Peter, inseparable, as it were, from Christ, according
to his own testimony, <i>Lord, to whom shall we
go? Thou hast the words of eternal life</i>,—Peter, I say,
when he saw his Master rise from the supper of the
law, and gird Himself with the towel, pour water into
a basin, and stoop to wash his feet, refused to permit
Him to do it: <i>Thou shalt never wash my feet</i>. Oh,
Peter! hast thou forgotten thy words to thy Lord:
<i>Bid me come to Thee on the water</i>? And why wilt thou
not dip thy feet in water when thy Lord cometh to
thee? Thou art ready to go with Him <i>to prison and to
death</i>, and that thou mayest go the better, He who
giveth <i>His angels charge concerning thee</i>, is conforming
thy feet that they may bear thee up, <i>lest thou dash thy
foot against a stone</i>. Ay! He is placing His hands
beneath thy feet to bear thee up Himself, lest thou
stumble at the stone of stumbling and rock of offence.
Why delay? Why shrink back? Why recoil? God
loveth not headstrong piety, nor an obstinate self-will!
Listen, Peter, to what Christ answers thee: <i>If I wash
thee not, thou hast no part with Me</i>. So many words,
so many lightnings! by these Peter is threatened, not
with prison and darkness, not with horrors and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
wretchedness, not with pyres and wheels, but with the
absence of Christ Himself, <i>Thou hast no part with Me</i>.…
Touched by this lightning-stroke, Peter exclaims:
<i>Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and
my head</i>.</p>

<p>4. …</p>

<p>5. Fatal will be that last sentence: <i>Depart from Me,
ye cursed, into everlasting fire</i>. Here observe that the
first portion of the sentence refers to expulsion from
Christ’s presence as the chief pain of hell. Of which says
St. Chrysostom: “This pain is worse than to be tortured
in the flames.” And St. Bruno: “Let torments be
added to torments, let cruel ministers cruelly rack, let
all kinds of scourges increase their severity, but let us
not be deprived of God, whose absence would be the
worst of tortures.” And that this may be confirmed
by the mouths of three witnesses, B. Laurentius Justiniani
says, “The interminable want of the beatific
vision will excel all other woes.”</p>

<p>Certainly the damned would feel no pain if they could
see Jesus. Three children were cast into the burning
fiery furnace of Babylon, and they trampled on the
flames, they sang among their torments, and called
upon all creatures to unite with them in praise. Would
you know the reason? We have it from the mouth of
the hostile king: <i>Lo! I see four men loose, walking in
the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the
form of the fourth is like the Son of God</i>. The form,
the very image only, of the Son of God was sufficient
to remove all power from the fierce element, to turn
torment into jubilee, punishment into delight, a furnace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
into a joke (<i>focum in jocum</i>; a pun), a torturer’s pyre
into festive flames. No less would the damned rejoice
if they could thus behold the Son of God, and would set
at nought fire, hell, and damnation.</p>

<p>6. Oh! if after myriads of years they were given a
chance of obtaining one thing from Christ, would they
ask of Him any thing else but that which the blind man
required—<i>Lord, that I may see</i>? Why did the damned
Dives ask that Lazarus might come with a drop of
water at the tip of his finger to cool his parched tongue?
Why did he not rather demand a refreshing shower, or
a pleasant rill of cool water to flow into his throat?
It was because he desired the presence of the glorified
Lazarus. By that presence all his pains would be relieved,
his hell would be turned into Paradise. The
longed-for Lazarus is the very Son of God, who suffered
poverty at the gate of the rich, asking for a little crumb
of comfort, but in vain; rejected by the Jews, the dogs
of Gentiles came, and found healing in His wounds.</p>

<p>Now the damned desire of the Father that He should
send His Son, who with the finger of God’s right hand,
the Holy Spirit, might touch the stream of celestial joys,
and let one drop distil into the consuming fire, to refresh
the lost for one moment, to give them for one
instant a glimpse of the beauty of that radiant countenance.
But in vain; in vain they ask, they cry, they
weep; they shall see the face of Jesus no more.</p>

<p>The sentence was pronounced against the children
of outer darkness when God said, <i>My face will I turn
also from them</i>. The hiding of that countenance is the
source of all ills. <i>My face will I turn from them!</i> they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
have set the face of men before them in the place of
Mine. They have loved the beauty of human countenances
rather than the glory of Mine which is divine.
<i>My face will I turn from them!</i> I, who turned not My
face from those who spat upon it, and buffeted Me.
<i>My face will I turn from them</i>, and My face is <i>as the sun</i>,
and <i>they shall never see light</i>; My face, which is the
source of all gladness; <i>Lord, lift Thou up the light of Thy
countenance upon us. Thou hast put gladness in my heart</i>,
and they shall be sad; My face, the prospect of beholding
which tempers more than did the hopes of
possessing Rachel. They shall labour for ever without
rest, or solace, or refreshment. And this is the sum of
their woes, that Jesus, whom they lost in the way of life,
they find not again, and shall not see or grasp through
ages evermore.</p>

<p>7. Oh, weeping mother of Jesus! who soughtest Him
whom thou hadst lost, through no fault of thine own;
by that pain, that anxiety, that aching void thou didst
endure through three days when thy Son was absent;
keep, I pray thee, thy Jesus and my Jesus in our souls,
that we may never lose Him through our grave offence.
Rather may the world perish, and all the vanity therein,
than that thy Jesus should be lost to us! Rather may
health and life, and good report, and fortune, hope and
all things perish, if only we may keep Jesus, without
whom all things else are nought, for He is all in all.</p>

<p class="center">The Second Sunday after Easter.</p>

<p class="center">Rural Sermon.</p>

<p class="center"><i>On Heaven.</i>—VI.</p>

<p class="center">The unity and concord of the Heaven-dwellers.</p>

<p class="center">John x. 16. <i>There shall be one fold and one shepherd.</i></p>

<p>1. And when will that happy time at last arrive,
when the fold will be but one, and one the Shepherd,
so that once more all shall be <i>of one heart and of one soul</i>
among those that believe?</p>

<p>Alas! the fold of Christ has ever been broken
through: Nicolaitans and Corinthians in apostolic times,
then Gnostics, Manichæans, Arians, Donatists. These
were followed by Iconoclasts, Albigenses, Hussites and
sects of this age, which I will not name<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>.</p>

<p>Shall there ever be discord in the faith? Shall we
in the same fold be ever severed in heart?… Unity
is not to be found here: not here, but in Heaven,
where the Pastor is one, and the God triune; where
the flock is twofold, human and angelic. Of the concord
of the blessed shall I now speak.…</p>

<p>2. There is not so great a variety among garden
flowers or meadow herbs, among forest trees, among
fishes of the sea or birds of the air, among meats at a
feast or nations upon earth, as there is among the
saints. Yet, though so great is the variety, great also
is the harmony. The Psalmist, considering the wondrous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
unity of the saints, breaks forth into praise to
God, who <i>maketh men to be of one mind in an house</i>.
They have the same will, not as brothers, but as one
man, and yet they are of all tribes, and tongues, and
nations, and they are a <i>great multitude which no man
can number</i>, yet all understand each other, for each
can speak all tongues.</p>

<p>The variety of nations, and sexes, and states, and
merits, and natures will afford delight. The angels in
their three hierarchies, in each of which are three
choirs, and in each choir nine mansions; thus are they
divided, yet in this great crowd there is no crowding.
The limbs are not bound to the body as closely as the
elect are united in the bonds of their charity. Why
are the members of the body so united? Because, forsooth,
they communicate into one spirit. Though their
natures may differ, and their offices vary, one soul conciliates
them; then how much more will the Divine
Spirit, by whom all the elect live, make unity such as
this and much more excellent. None will contradict,
none contend with, none emulate, none envy another.
<i>Without are dogs.</i> In that country there will be no
Cain to slay his brother Abel; in that family there will
be no Jacob to hate Esau; in that house no Ishmael to
contend with Isaac; in that kingdom no Saul to persecute
David; in that college no Judas to betray his
Master. Hence their exceeding joy. <i>Behold, how good
and joyful a thing it is, brethren, to dwell together in unity!</i>
All will the same thing, for all have but one rule which
they observe, the will of God, against which they can
rebel no more.… Wherefore, because it is the will of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
God that Peter should be greater than James, each
will be content, each will rejoice in the joy of the other
as though it were his own. Consequently, St. Augustine
says, “Each will be glad in the beatitude of another, as
much as in his own ineffable joy, and he who has friends
has as many joys. Whatever is needful, whatever
pleases, is there; all riches, all rest, all solace. For
what can be wanting to him where God is, to whom
nothing lacks? There, all know God without error,
see Him without end, praise Him without fatigue, love
Him without fail. And in this delight, all repose full
of God; cleaving ever to blessedness, they are blessed;
contemplating ever eternity, they are eternal.” See
how good and how pleasant! so pleasant, that one day
granted in Heaven in the enjoyment of the society
of the blessed would be of sufficient value to make us
resign all the delights of this life, to make us renounce
all evil companionship. <i>One day in Thy courts is better
than a thousand.</i> For all joys, all pleasures of this
world, as compared to the perennial delight in Heaven
flowing from the vision of God and the society of the
saints, are but as a drop to the ocean.</p>

<p>3. Man is a social animal, and though he may abound
in all, yet if he have not a companion he is not happy.
Let a man be shut up in a palace or a garden, and be
left alone, he will soon weary of the solitude, and ask
to be either let go or to have a companion admitted.
God Himself judged this when He saw that it was not
well for Adam to be alone, even in Paradise. Seneca
said divinely, “The possession of no good is pleasant
without a companion.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>God, though He needs none, yet seems to affect
society, for He says, <i>My delights were with the sons of
men</i>. Indeed, when He designed to form man, He
said, <i>Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.
Let us make</i>, one labour of the Three Persons; and
the one work is social man. <i>After our likeness</i>, that
as there is plurality of Persons in one Nature, so there
might be a plurality of bodies, yet a unity of souls.
But this unity will not be perfect, this likeness complete,
except in the celestial Paradise, where, says St. John,
<i>we shall be like Him</i>; then, indeed, many will be one,
and one like all, in the admirable unity of souls.
Drexelius ingeniously observes, “God found an admirable
art, by which a happy one might make the joys
of many myriads his own, and thus each might be
hundredfold happy.” The art consists in this, that the
thought is deep rooted in each of the blessed ones, a
thought sweeter than honey: God loves me intimately
and infinitely, and I love God with my whole being;
and these all love me, and I love them; eternally shall
I be loved, eternally loving. Hence the immense joy
which each feels in the other’s happiness.… Isaiah
beholding this celestial charity, this goodly unity in the
land flowing with milk and honey, says, <i>My people
shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings,
and in quiet resting-places</i>.</p>

<p><i>Shall sit down</i> (Vulg.). This the position, this the
mark of perennial rest. Now we stand and fight till
we drop into our graves.… <i>In the beauty of peace</i>
(Vulg.). Beautiful is that which is perfect; in Heaven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
peace is most beautiful, for there is it altogether most
perfect. <i>In the tabernacles of confidence</i> (Vulg.). When
six hundred thousand men went forth out of Egypt, they
dwelt in tabernacles, but not in confidence; in tabernacles
of fear and anxiety, for the way before them was
to be opened by the sword, and the foe was to be
dreaded on every side. But in Heaven there is no foe,
nothing hostile, no ambushes, no heartburnings; but
security and confidence, unity and charity; therefore
they sit down in <i>wealthy rest</i> (Vulg.), for they will not
only possess what they have hoped for, but more than
they hoped for, ay! more than they were capable of
hoping for. One possesses what all possess, and therefore
they are all of <i>one heart and of one soul</i>.</p>

<p>4. But how will it be, that with such disparity of
rewards, there will be no strife and envy? This may
best be explained by a simile. If a father had ten
sons of different statures, and were to dress them
each alike in silk, the smallest would not envy the
greatest because his breast was wider, his sleeves fuller,
his cloak longer, but would be content with his own
little tunic, and would be unwilling to exchange it.
So, too, the eldest would be well pleased in the little
brother because he was suitably equipped. The same
too in a banquet, where each may drink what, and how
much, he likes. But St. Augustine has a more graceful
simile, taken from the strings of a harp. The
strings are of various lengths, but when struck they
produce harmony. “The saints will have their own
harmonious differences in degrees, just as the sweetest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
music is that produced by diverse, but not adverse
sounds.”</p>

<p>5. He who would attain to this most blessed society,
ought to be in the fold of Christ, that one, true, good
Church Catholic, which is the fold of Christ, beyond
which is neither unity of doctrine nor the bond of the
Good Shepherd’s charity.</p>

<p>Secondly, let the Christians who are in this fold
learn from the sheep to seek unity. Let them remain
closely bound to each other, and not bite each other
as dogs, nor rend as wolves, nor kick as horses, nor butt
as goats; so, O Christian, abstain from tossing thy
neighbour on the horns of pride, injuring him with the
bark of envy, rending him with the tooth of detraction;
but like a gentle lamb cleave to the Good Shepherd,
and thou shalt be of the dear sheep of Christ. For
what St. Bonaventura says seraphically, touching the
religious state, is to be repeated a thousand times:
“There is no greater proof of a man’s predestination,
and that he is conforming himself to God, than that he
should exhibit himself to be gentle and patient,” and
I add, that he should show his love for concord and
unity.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I think that no one can peruse these two sermons,
which I have given almost entire, curtailing them but
slightly, without being convinced of the overflowing
charity and deep-seated piety of the holy man who
wrote them. Whatever there may be of crudity in the
style, every thought gushes from the pure spring of the
love of God, open and flowing in the heart of the good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Jesuit. <i>He that believeth on Me, out of his belly shall flow
rivers of living water</i>, may justly be applied to Philip von
Hartung. Many and many a rill of the water of Life
may be lighted on in the garden of delights contained
in his volumes. Often, perhaps, the water is discoloured,
but more often is it limpid and crystalline as
when it leaped out of the fount of God.</p>

<p>In style Hartung resembles the more earnest preachers
of dissent, because he speaks from the heart. <i>Out of
the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.</i> If our
preachers had the zeal and the love of God which was
found among the great Catholic orators, and is still to
be discovered among dissenting ministers, there would
be fewer complaints of the barrenness of the land, less
deadness to the calls of God in professed Church-goers.
It is quite impossible for a preacher to effect the slightest
good unless he feels what he says from the depths of
his soul; it is hopeless for him to expect to draw hearts
to the love of Jesus, if he knows not what that love is.
And the sermon, however eloquent and finished in
style, will never convert sinners, unless its inspiration
is derived from God; and that inspiration can alone be
obtained by prayer.</p>

<p>He who prays much is filled with a power of winning
souls quite inexplicable; he sheds a sort of magnetic
influence upon hearts, drawing them to Christ; and,
though the words be few and ill-chosen, they can do a
work for God which the most polished masterpiece of
elocution would be powerless to effect.</p>

<p>I think the story is told of Francis Borgia, that he
was asked to preach at a certain church in a distant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
city. On his arrival he was too ill to speak, and he
requested some one to occupy his place. “No!” said
the priest who had summoned him; “only mount the
pulpit, say nothing, and come away.” He did so;
hearts were touched, people burst into tears, and the
confessionals were filled with penitents. He was a
man of <i>Prayer</i>.</p>

<h2 id="JOSEPH_DE_BARZIA">JOSEPH DE BARZIA.</h2>

<p>I know of no preacher of his age who comes so near to
Paolo Segneri, the great luminary of Italian eloquence,
as this Spaniard, De Barzia. He flourished at the beginning
of the seventeenth century, and was Bishop of Cadiz.</p>

<p>His works are:—</p>

<p>Christianus animarum excitator. Auctore J. de Barzia,
Soc. Jesu; Augustæ Vindelicorum, 1721, 2 vols.
folio.</p>

<p>There is, I believe, a mistake in this title; Joseph de
Barzia was not a Jesuit; at all events, the brothers
Bächer have not included him in their catalogue.</p>

<p>Compendium excitatoris Christiani; lingua primum
Hispanica vulgatum ipsomet ab Auctore Rdo. D. Josepho
de Barzia Episcopo Gaditano, nunc demum Latine versum
a R. P. Petro Gummersbach, Soc. Jesu; Coloniæ,
1724, 4to.</p>

<p>Manductio ad excitationem Christianorum; seu, Sermones
Missionales. Auctore Jos. de Barzia; Augustæ
Vindelic., 1732, 2 vols. in one, 8vo. Ibid. 1737, 2 vols.
in one, 8vo.</p>

<p>The sermons of De Barzia are model mission-discourses;
they are interesting, pointed, full of illustration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
and anecdote, and are eminently qualified to arrest
the attention, and arouse the consciences of the hearers.</p>

<p>The good Bishop possessed the art of never suffering
the attention of his audience to flag. He carefully
avoided wearing his subject thread-bare, and the
moment he saw that his shot had taken effect, he
opened a new battery from another point altogether, yet
aimed at the same object.</p>

<p>His knowledge of the Bible is wonderful, even for
a Roman Catholic Post-Mediæval preacher; his sermons
teem with Scriptural illustrations of the most
apposite character, culled from every portion of Holy
Writ. It is not that he affects quotations from Scripture
in the manner of Helmesius, who, in an Advent
sermon, could make one hundred and seventy-five quotations,
but that he found in his Bible an inexhaustible
store of illustration for every subject which he handled.</p>

<p>The majority of Mediæval sacred orators, and their
immediate followers, seemed to think, and consequently
speak, in Scripture terms, but De Barzia preaches to
unlettered men, who knew little or nothing of their
Bibles, beyond the broad outlines of sacred history, and
who would not recognize quotations from the prophetic
books or the Epistles. He therefore avoids these to a
considerable extent, unless he can point them out severally
as words of Scripture, and confines himself chiefly
to the narrative portions of the inspired volume. He
selects an incident which can bear upon his subject,
relates it in the most vigorous style, and then applies
it with force and effect.</p>

<p>And these happy selections show such thorough acquaintance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
with the sacred writings, that it is impossible
not to see that Holy Scripture formed the staple
of the good Bishop’s meditations, night and day. His
sermons are eminently practical; they are not dogmatic.
De Barzia makes no attempt to instruct in
Catholic doctrine, he presupposes that his hearers are
orthodox, he does not suggest the possibility of there
being a heretic among them, he makes no attempt to
arm them for the conflict of the faith, but he goes
straight as an arrow to their consciences, and stirs them
to the perception of their moral obligations.</p>

<p>In this he differs widely from the German and French
preachers of his age, who seldom preached without
firing a broadside at heresy, and generally took the
opportunity to furnish their hearers with arguments in
favour of Catholic doctrines and practices.</p>

<p>De Barzia is more subjective than the other
preachers of his day, and he excels in sermons calculated
to strike terror into the impenitent heart. Each
man has his special line, and his was the declaration of
God’s judgments. Marchantius would melt the stony
heart with love, De Barzia shatter it with fear. And
yet his soul was full of tenderness and the love of God,
which exude from him occasionally, as the aromatic
gum from the frankincense.</p>

<p>For instance, take the following:—“Ungrateful
sinner, let me speak to thee in the name of Jesus crucified—‘Why!’
says He to thee, ‘who filled thee with
such rage against Me? <i>What iniquity have your fathers
found in Me?</i> (Jer. ii. 5.) Of what sin canst thou
charge Me, that thou ragest so furiously against Me?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
<i>Many good things have I showed you</i>; I have displayed
abundant charity, I have poured forth many benefits;
<i>for which of those works do ye stone Me?</i> (John x. 32.)
Art thou enraged against Me because I brought thee
into existence out of nothing? Art thou vexed because
I have watchfully preserved thee? because I have
brought thee to a saving faith? Dost thou count it
an injury that I gave up life and honour, blood and all,
upon the cross for thee?… Come now, answer
thou Me, wherefore art thou enraged against Me?’ O
Jesu, best beloved! cease to inquire! I own that there
is no cause, I acknowledge my audacity, and I bewail
it! Flow, my tears, flow, and streaming over my
cheeks, testify to my sorrow! Break, O heart, break,
through excess of love! I acknowledge, I own, I see
clearly my condition. What have I done! I have
returned Thee evil for good, and hatred for Thy good
will. Which was it, love or enmity, which crucified
Thee? O Lord! it was love, and it was enmity. Thine
the love, mine the enmity.”</p>

<p>The following abstract is a good specimen of the
Bishop’s quaintness.</p>

<p class="center">The Seventeenth Sunday after Pentecost.</p>

<p class="center">Sermon III.</p>

<p class="center">God is to be loved with the whole heart, and even
light sins are to be avoided.</p>

<p class="center">Matt. xxii. 37. <i>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
all thy heart.</i></p>

<p>The unhappy Ishbosheth, son of Saul, was slain in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
his own house, after the destruction of his father’s
army. How, think you? Was the door open for the
foe to enter? It was open: for he had been winnowing
wheat; and they <i>came about the heat of the day to
the house of Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon. And
they came thither into the midst of the house, as though
they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him.</i>
(2 Sam. iv. 5, 6.) Here was neglect of ordinary watchfulness,
a little heedlessness, a little drowsiness, a little
care for the wheat, leading to loss of life. St. Eucher
says truly, “When man loses the solicitude of discretion,
he leaves the door open for the ingress of evil
spirits to the slaying of his soul.”</p>

<p>Truly, many an ill has come to us through this
indifference to our danger, through carelessness for our
spiritual peril.</p>

<p>Oh, what precious swords are rusted, because they
are not drawn from their scabbards!</p>

<p>Oh, what noble horses become sluggish in their
stalls, because they are not exercised!</p>

<p>Oh, what crystalline pools nourish reptiles, because
they are not stirred!</p>

<p>Oh, what great souls, living in honour and purity,
have fallen into an abyss of sin, because they have been
negligent! “For,” says Lessius, “he who serves God
negligently, deserves in return that God should not
exert Himself to care so greatly for him.”</p>

<p>Little venial faults begin to accumulate and increase
till the whole moral nature is clouded by them.
The intellect is darkened, the fervour of charity cooled,
the spirit stained; the strength fails in temptation, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
soul is enervated in prayer, the whole man is neglectful
in the practice of good works; and why? Because he
has neglected to purge himself of his little faults, to
struggle against his infirmities. King David often
cried to God, <i>Incline Thine ear unto me; bow down Thine
ear to me</i>. (Ps. xvii. 6; xxxi. 2; lxxi. 2.) It was not
enough that God should hear his prayer, but He must
also bow down over him. Just as sick men, when their
voices are broken and faint with disease, require the
physician to incline his ear to their lips; so does
David, well knowing how weakened and broken is his
prayer through venial sins and daily transgressions,
ask God in like manner to incline His ear to him.</p>

<p>Oh, how great is the evil arising from little ills! A
grain of sand, how light it is! but many grains accumulated
will sink a stately vessel! How light is a drop
of rain! yet many gathered into one stream will submerge
houses! How trifling is the loss of a little tile!
yet it will admit the rain to rot the timber, to break
down the walls, and to produce a ruin!</p>

<p>In like manner one little venial sin may lead to
destruction, if it be neglected. It is a trifle looked at
by itself, but it has brought a soul to perdition, in that,
as St. Thomas asserts, a venial sin may dispose towards
the commission of a deadly sin!</p>

<p>It is worth noting, the manner in which the sea-crab
gets an oyster and eats it. In the morning early
the oyster gapes, that it may bask in the sunbeams.
Then up steals the crab, not boldly advancing upon the
fish, or it would at once close its shell and escape him,
or clutch him tight by his claws. What course does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the crafty animal adopt? It takes a little pebble and
tosses it into the oyster. This prevents the valves from
closing, and then he rushes up and devours the oyster
at his leisure.</p>

<p>Soul of man! just so comes the evil one towards
thee; not alluring thee to some sin of horrible deadliness,
but flinging a little pebble—a tiny fault—into
thy heart, and if thou cast it not from thee at once, but
keepest thy heart still unclosed, he obtaineth an entry
and destroyeth thee utterly.</p>

<p>Take another specimen. The following passages are
condensed from a sermon on the vanity of all the labour
of sinners, and the lamentations of lost souls when they
behold in retrospect their life squandered in empty
trifles.</p>

<p class="center">The Fourth Sunday after Pentecost.</p>

<p class="center">Sermon III.</p>

<p class="center">Luke v. 5. <i>We have toiled all the night, and have taken
nothing.</i></p>

<p>Those words of Job are worthy of notice, <i>I have
made my bed in the darkness</i>. I will explain them to
you by the use of a simile.</p>

<p>A lighted candle is given to a servant that he may
retire to rest by its light, after that he has made his
bed. The fellow snatches up the candle and begins to
wander about the house, dawdling over this or that,
gossiping with one or another, till the candle is expended,
flickers up, and dies out. Then, in hurry, he
runs to his chamber, but he is without light, and he is
constrained to make and to retire to his <i>bed in the darkness</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
O Christian soul! if you sigh for the rest of
eternal glory, know that God has given to you for the
very purpose of finding it, and preparing for it, the
taper of life. If you consume that life in idleness and
in vanities, you will have to make your bed in the darkness,
and in the outer darkness lie down to rest,—to
rest! oh, no! to seek rest, and find none on that ill-made
couch, to toil all the night of eternity and to take
nothing; for the time of preparation has been wasted,
and the work which was to be done has been neglected
till the allotted time for doing it has expired.</p>

<p>Of the virtuous woman declared King Solomon,
<i>She layeth her hands to the spindle.</i> Where is the flax?
“Spun,” says St. Ambrose. See what a mystery is involved
here! The flax is attached to the head of the
distaff, and the spun thread is twisted round the
spindle. “On the distaff is that which is to be done,
on the spindle that which is done,” says the same
Father. Therefore does Solomon commend the just
soul which has accomplished its work, not that which
has its work to accomplish: for that soul which has
finished its work is secure, not that which has to commence
it. Look, then, to thy spindle, see if of the
work God has set before thee any is spun off and completed;
if so, there lay thy hand, for there is thy virtue,
there thy security. Christian man! that the praise of
the virtuous soul may be thine, it behoveth thee not to
have a handful of flax at thy distaff-head, but a
full spindle at thy side: not purposes, but acts; not
confession to be made, but confession made; not restitution
to be accomplished, but restitution accomplished;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
not injuries to be forgiven, but injuries already forgiven.
Things that are future are but flax on the
distaff-head, flax which will blaze up and leave no
trace; but things of the present are thread spun, and
therefore is the virtuous woman commended, who layeth
her hands to the spindle.</p>

<p>Terrible is the sentence of God in Deuteronomy:
<i>If I whet My glittering sword, and Mine hand take hold
of judgment; I will render vengeance to Mine enemies.</i>
(Deut. xxxii. 41.) And where will God whet His
glittering sword? Where are blades usually whetted?
Let us look. Surely on a whirling circular stone. And
on what stone will God whet His sword? I reply, on
that stony heart of the sinner, which is ever revolving,
never at rest. Watch the grindstone a little while.
See how it plunges down into a trough of turbid, foul,
and muddy water. O stone, stone! why rush down
into this filth? Rise up, rise up from this uncleanness.
I put my hand to it, I set the stone in motion.
How easily is it made to revolve! It moves—it leaves
that sink of filth—it mounts upwards. In vain! It whirls
round, and with a rush seeks again its bed of pollution.</p>

<p>Heart of sinner, hard and stony! why dost thou
not emerge from the corruption in which thou wallowest?
‘I will emerge,’ thou repliest. Why dost thou
not leave thy enmities, thy passions, thy shameful uncleanness?
‘I will leave them,’ is thy answer. And
yet nothing comes of these fine promises. Always on
the move like the grindstone, you never remove from
the trough of slime; always leaving sin, that with
fresh relish you may plunge into it again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>Know, you sinners who are so full of good resolutions
which come to nought, so full of promises of
amendment which end in relapse, that it is on whirling
grindstones such as you that <i>the glittering sword</i> of
Divine vengeance is whetted. <i>If I whet My glittering
sword, … I will render vengeance to Mine enemies.</i></p>

<p>To whom, I ask, will He render vengeance? To His
enemies; to those such as you who have such excellent
purposes, but who have never accomplished one good
purpose. Then when that sword is whetted, too late
will you exclaim with the lost, ‘We have erred, we have
erred, we have taken nothing!’ Wretched sinners!
do you hear these threats, these warnings, these words
of God calling you to repentance? You hear, and yet
you stop your ears as the deaf adder; you despise, you
laugh, you mock, you harden into stone!</p>

<p>Well, then, be hard as stone, have your laugh out,
despise as you will, stop your ears! you are at liberty so
to do! Yet, mark me, the time will assuredly come
when the laugh will be turned against you.</p>

<p><i>Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched
out My hand, and no man regarded; but ye have set at
nought all My counsel, and would none of My reproof</i>:
awful is that which follows! <i>I also will laugh at your
calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh.</i> (Prov. i.
24-26.) O good God! O goodness immeasurable,
dost Thou laugh at the destruction of Thy sons! Alas!
terrible laughter is that indeed.</p>

<p>Hannibal is said, after the subjection of Carthage
by Rome, to have walked through the city, and, as he
saw the tears and heard the wailing of the people who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
groaned under the terrible burden imposed upon them
by the conquerors, to have laughed. Then, when his
fellow-citizens rose up against him in indignation, he
replied, “I laugh not from joy to see your bondage; but
I laugh at your tears, now too late, now in vain; for
had you in proper time fought as men, now you would
not be weeping as women.”</p>

<p>Behold, O sinners, as in a picture, your tears and
God’s laughter: you bewailing your misery, and God
laughing at your tears: you sobbing through eternity
under the burden of the Devil’s rule, and God laughing
at your sobs: you lamenting in the agony of eternal
fire, and God laughing at your lamentations: and all—because
when as Christians you might have fought the
good fight, now, when too late, you break forth into tears
which are vain, and into lamentations which are fruitless.</p>

<p>Surely this is a very terrible, yet striking sermon,
one sure to tell on rude and uncultivated minds, from
the vigour of the moral application, and the richness of
the imagery.</p>

<p>There are some very remarkable passages in the next
sermon, which is on the subject of the merit of good
works consisting in the inward disposition, and not in
the magnitude of the outward act.</p>

<p>De Barzia relates the story of the anointing of David.
He pictures Samuel before the sons of Jesse admiring
the stalwart form of Eliab, and the stature of Aminadab,
and thinking that one of these must be the destined
king. Yet no—it is none of these. The word of God
bids him anoint David, the youngest, the feeblest, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
shepherd boy: for <i>the Lord said unto Samuel, Look not
on his countenance.… Man looketh on the outward appearance,
but the Lord looketh on the heart.</i> Oh! exclaims
the Bishop, how different are the judgments of God
from those of man!</p>

<p>Men often preach up some act as great and wonderful
which is worthless in God’s judgment. Men
estimate the quality of a work from the outside, God
weighs the inward intent of the soul: as says the wisest
of kings: <i>All the ways of a man are clean in his own
eyes; but the Lord weigheth the spirits</i>. (Prov. xvi. 2.)
This is the difference between the judgments of God
and of man, and this difference will be made manifest
when all things shall be revealed before the Divine
tribunal. To that judgment-seat will come the
Christian soul and there give account of all its works,
its alms, its fasts, its prayers: boastfully perhaps it will
advance, resting on the multitude of these, reckoning
to enter through them into life everlasting, and to
merit the crown of immortality.</p>

<p>Look! what an eminent work of mercy! a large sum
of money given as dower to a poor girl! Look! what
a meritorious fast! three days’ abstinence on bread and
water! <i>Look not on his countenance.</i> To the eye these
seem to be great works, and yet they are accounted as
nothing by God, because they were not wrought with a
right intent: whereas the crust of stale bread given
in the name of a disciple, and out of love to God, is rewarded
with a crown of eternal glory. I am reminded,
says the preacher, of a story told by John Geminiano,
which is to the point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>Two women came before a judge, contending about
the ownership to a clew of wool, which each claimed to
be her own.</p>

<p>The judge inquired as to the shred upon which the
wool had been wound. One woman declared she had
wound it upon a bit of black rag, another affirmed that
the piece was white. Then the judge ordered the wool
to be unwound, and delivered it over to the woman who
had asserted that she had used a black rag; for the end
of the thread was found twined round a black centre.</p>

<p>Oh! how carefully will all excuses, all outward
appearances, be wound off at the last, and the true
intent within be revealed! Now every act is like a
clew, and who can tell what lies at its core, and what
its origin?—all that is hidden. Now self-love persuades
man that his show of virtue is wound about the best intention,
as a white bobbin, but too often has it been
coiled about the black one of vanity or self-will.</p>

<p>“Let each man fear,” says St. Bernard, “lest, in that
searching examination, his righteousness prove to be
sin.” The Amalekite soldier, who dealt King Saul his
death-blow, came exultingly to David expecting great
reward, and lo! he received the punishment of death;
in like manner will many a man at the last perish eternally
who has expected to triumph.…</p>

<p>When thou appearest before God the righteous
Judge, say, whose will be the works thou hast wrought?
Thy studies, thy labours, thy vigils, thy cares, thy
traffic, thy contracts, thy business of life, whose will
they be? Works of salvation to thee, or works of
avarice? All the many Sacrifices of the altar at which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
thou hast assisted! All the pious sermons thou hast
listened to, all the alms thou hast distributed, all the
penances thou hast undergone, all the Communions thou
hast received, all the fasts and mortifications thou hast
undertaken, all the works of mercy thou hast performed!
Tell me, are they to be referred to nature or to grace, to
reason or to concupiscence, to self-love or to the love of
God? Tell me, are they works meriting eternal salvation,
or deserving condemnation? <i>Whose shall those
things be which thou hast provided?</i></p>

<p>Christian soul, all this is now veiled in mystery inscrutable,
but this will be made manifest before the sun,
when the Judge shall call up for examination all thy
works, and pronounce upon them, one after another,
according to the end, according to the method, according
to the intent, according to the circumstances wherewith
they have been wrought.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This admirable lesson is taken from the first sermon
for the Sixth Sunday after Pentecost. I will now
give a sketch of one of De Barzia’s complete sermons;
and I shall select for the purpose one on the subject
of the solemn account those will have to give who
hinder others in their spiritual progress.</p>

<p>There are other sermons by the preacher on the same
subject, but this is the best among discourses which are
all very good. To my taste this sermon is superior to
any by Paolo Segneri.</p>

<p>The text is from the Gospel for the day—with us, the
Gospel for the Purification.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">The Sunday after Christmas Day.</p>

<p class="center">Sermon II.</p>

<p class="center">Luke ii. 40. <i>And the child grew, and waxed strong
in spirit, filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was
upon Him.</i></p>

<p><i>Exordium.</i> Among other iniquities which Absalom
committed in his rebellion, perhaps the chief was that
he, by flatteries and fair promises, stole away the hearts
of the men of Israel from their allegiance to David.</p>

<p>Foolish youth! exclaims the preacher; see the
veterans of the king drawn up before thee in battle
array! See the army of mighty warriors assembled to
overthrow thee! Thy destruction impends; it is but a
matter of a few hours more or less. Yet, lo! on the
contrary, I see David fleeing; David, the mighty man of
war; David, who shrank not before Goliath; David, who
quailed not before Saul; he, even he, without striking a
blow, turns his back to flee before an undisciplined
rabble! How can we account for this? Chrysostom
replies, “David fled, not because he feared, but because
he did not choose to see his son slain before his eyes.”
It was love, not fear, which put him to flight. So great
was the guilt of Absalom in weaning the children of
Israel from their duty, that it could only be washed out
in the blood of the offender. And all those who by
enticing words, or by evil example, allure others from
their duty to God, their true King, act as did Absalom,
and like Absalom will be slain, <i>all the sort of them</i>.</p>

<p><i>Propositio.</i> The subject of this sermon is the severe
judgment which will fall on all those who put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
stumbling-blocks in the way of their brethren, or who, in
any way, impede their spiritual progress.</p>

<p><i>Confirmatio.</i> We do not hear of God’s wrath being
kindled against any nation so fiercely as against
Amalek. <i>I will blot out the remembrance of Amalek
from under Heaven</i>, He swore, and He bade Saul again
and again, <i>Go and smite Amalek</i>. What was the sin
of this people, that Divine fury should thus be roused
against it? The answer is threefold.</p>

<p>First, the children of Amalek opposed the progress of
the Israelites to the Promised Land; and Moses reminded
the people that this sin was not to go unpunished:
<i>Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way, when
ye were come forth out of Egypt; how he met thee by the
way, and smote the hindermost of thee, even all that were
feeble behind thee, when thou wast faint and weary; therefore
it shall be, when the Lord thy God giveth thee rest from
all thine enemies round about, in the land which the Lord
thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it, that
thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under
Heaven; thou shalt not forget it.</i> (Deut. xxv. 17-19.)</p>

<p>But this is not a sufficient answer. Did not other
nations rise up against Israel to withstand them in their
advance? The Midianites fought against them; the
Amorites blocked their way; Og, King of Basan, fell
upon them; and yet against these no such fearful denunciations
of wrath were launched. <i>The Lord hath
sworn, that the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation
to generation.</i> And four hundred years after:
<i>Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, I remember that which
Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
when he came up from Egypt. Now go and smite Amalek,
and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not;
but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and
sheep, camel and ass.</i> (1 Sam. xv. 3.) For the second
reason turn to the thirty-sixth chapter of Genesis.</p>

<p><i>Timna was concubine to Eliphaz, Esau’s son; and she
bare to Eliphaz Amalek.</i> Consequently the Israelites
and the Amalekites were near of kin; they were sprung
from the loins of one father, Isaac. This nation, consequently,
which was bound by kindred to assist the
Israelites, forgot its ties of blood, and fell upon them.</p>

<p>There is also a third reason for the annihilation of
Amalek. It was the <span class="smcapuc">FIRST</span> of all the nations to assault
the chosen people, the first to fall upon them with the
sword, the first to stop the way to the Promised Land.
This was the final reason why Amalek was singled
out for such overwhelming destruction that Balaam in
prophecy could exclaim: <i>Amalek was the first of the nations
that warred against Israel</i> (marg.), <i>but his latter end
shall be that he perish for ever</i>. The children of Israel
were in a critical position when encamped at Rephidim:
they had just escaped from Egypt, and in a few days
they might return thither if their hearts failed at
the prospect of war. They had begun to sigh for
the leeks, and the onions, and the flesh-pots of
Egypt, and but little more was wanting to bring
their discontent to a climax, and to send them back
to their captivity. Amalek, being the first to attack
them, set an example to other nations of the land,
provoking Midianite, Moabite, and Amorite to regard
the chosen people of God as enemies instead of treating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
them as wayfarers, to impede their progress instead of
opening to them a passage.</p>

<p><i>Applicatio.</i> From this learn, Christian soul, that if
God chose to annihilate this people because it hindered
the chosen race in its progress to the Land of Promise,
because it opposed this people which it was bound by
relationship to assist, because it was the first to do so,
thereby encouraging others to stand against it—then
great indeed will be God’s wrath with you, if you prevent
others from reaching the Heavenly Canaan, they
being members of the same spiritual family, and you
being the one to encourage others to destroy the souls
for which Christ died.</p>

<p>Let infidel, heathen, and heretic persecute, their
guilt is tolerable compared to yours; if you lead from
the paths of righteousness, and you be the first so
to lead astray, one who is of the same household of
Faith, a brother, a relation, one redeemed by Christ’s
blood, a member of the same mystical body, of the same
Church—think what you are thereby doing! Christ,
the true Moses, is leading His people from the Egypt
of sin, through the wilderness of this world, into the
country of everlasting felicity. And what are you
doing? Barring the passage to God’s people, undoing
the work of Christ, setting at nought the blood of the
covenant. Terrible will be the condemnation of those
who act thus!</p>

<p>De Barzia, after having appealed earnestly to the
consciences of his hearers, and urged them to examine
themselves whether they have ever put an occasion
of falling in their brother’s way, bursts into a magnificent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
piece of irony. He says that he hears the
excuse made,—“Come, now! persecution is a strong
term, unjustifiably strong; I never persecuted any one
for leading a holy life: I may have teased So-and-so,
but that is all; just teased him in joke, you understand.”
In joke! a joke more ruinous than the worst
cruelty of a persecutor. A joke! Ah, ha! a right
merry joke, a capital joke, indeed! Go, cut the pipes
which bring water into this city—only in joke, of
course—cut the pipes, then, and watch the result.
Such a joke! the fountains fail, the mills cease working,
the gardens are parched up, men and beasts perish
through thirst. Oh, magnificent joke!</p>

<p>This the Bishop applies with all his vehemence and
fire. He then continues by reference to the old law:
<i>Life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand,
foot for foot, burning for burning, wound for wound,
stripe for stripe</i>. If a man smote another with a stone
and injured him, by the law of Moses he was bound to
pay for the cure of the injured man, and also for the
loss of time. By which is signified, that if any one by
evil example, or bad advice, cause spiritual sickness in
another, he must atone for that, suffering for the sins
which he has led his brother to commit.</p>

<p><i>Epilogus.</i> Woe to such an one on the last great
day, when the Judge says, “See, impious man, this
child was waxing strong <i>in spirit, filled with wisdom, and
the grace of God was upon him</i>, but you by your sneers
and ridicule, by your jests and scoffs, turned him aside
from the path of My commandments into the way of
death. You have made My labours for that poor soul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
in vain; come now, make recompense for all that you
have done,” and He shall deliver him to the tormentors
till he have paid the debt.</p>

<p>At the risk of wearying the reader, I shall give in
outline a specimen of one of De Barzia’s Saints’-day
sermons, and I select the third for the festival of St.
John the Divine.</p>

<p class="sermon center">Text, John xxi.—<i>What is that to thee?</i></p>

<p><i>Introduction.</i> Although our Lord promised to His
disciples that they should have whatsoever they asked,
yet He made the condition—<i>If ye abide in Me</i>. Wherefore?
Judas had at this time gone out, so that those to whom
the promise was made were certain to abide in Christ;
and He in His foreknowledge knew that of the eleven
all would remain constant till death. But Jesus spake
not out of His omniscience as God, but out of care for
the eleven, lest they should be elated and puffed up
with spiritual pride, knowing that they were ordained
to eternal life. Christ spoke conditionally, so as to
teach them fear and anxiety for themselves, and in
order to keep them humble.</p>

<p><i>Subject.</i> The uncertainty in which we are as to our
future condition is salutary; for it keeps us on the watch,
it makes us cautious and anxious about our salvation.</p>

<p><i>Confirmation.</i> When Jacob fled from Laban, he was
pursued by his father-in-law, who had lost his household
gods which Rebecca had stolen. Laban charged
Jacob with the theft, and Jacob bore the charge with
patience, and without resentment. But after that
Laban had searched through the goods of his son-in-law,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
<i>but found them not. And then</i>, but not till
then, <i>Jacob was wroth and chode with Laban</i>. (Gen.
xxxi. 36.) How was this? At first Jacob was full
of meekness, but now he is wroth. Oleaster gives
the reason, he says: “At first Jacob knew not whether
the idols were amongst his stuff or not, but now, the
moment that he feels himself secure, his anger breaks
forth against Laban for having accused him of the
theft. As long as he was afraid lest the idols should be
found, he was silent; but when they were not found,
then he became bold.” And which of you, Christian
souls, knows whether some idols may not be secreted in
the dark corners of your hearts, some secret sins buried
deep in your bosoms? No man knoweth. Wonderful
is the providence of God which leaves us ignorant as to
our final condition, so as to keep us humble. But suppose
now, O man! that you were assured of your final
acceptance, satisfied that there was no idol hidden in
the depths of your heart, would you not be filled with
pride as was Jacob, would you not break forth into words
of contempt for those who are not so sure?</p>

<p><i>Epilogue.</i> Thanks be to Thee, O infinite God, for
Thy great mercy in having veiled Thy final judgment
from our eyes, so that every one is rendered fearful lest
he should miss the prize of his high calling, and fail
to reach the crown for which he is now striving. For
Thou hast concealed it solely for our good: yet is our
future state foreknown to Thee; and Thou wouldst
have us serve Thee not for the hope of reward, or for
the fear of torment, but from love: and Thou art
worthy to be loved and served though there were no
future glory, no future hell.</p>

<h2 id="JACQUES_MARCHANT">JACQUES MARCHANT.</h2>

<p>Although the subject of this notice was well known
in his own day as an eloquent preacher, his sermons,
with few exceptions, have not come to us in their original
condition, and Marchant is known now chiefly as a
dogmatic and moral theologian. His great work, the
Hortus Pastorum, contains the notes of his sermons and
catechetical instructions, as we know from his own
account; and he published them in a compendious
form, that they might serve the like purpose to other
preachers. The Hortus Pastorum differs widely from
the Dictionaries and Libraries of Predication, which
issued from the press at the close of the Middle Ages;
for they contained crude extracts from the Fathers and
from Mediæval expositors of Holy Scripture, without
any attempt being made at digesting them into a form
ready for delivery, whereas each proposition of Marchant
might be pronounced from the pulpit verbatim,
and indeed possesses all the ring of a popular sermon.</p>

<p>Jacques Marchant flourished in the Low Countries at
the beginning of the seventeenth century. He had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
good fortune to sit at the feet of Cornelius à Lapide,
when that great man taught at Louvain, a circumstance
fully appreciated by Marchant, and referred to by him
with thankfulness in his preface.</p>

<p>He was appointed Professor of Theology in the Benedictine
monastery of Floreffe, which had been founded
in 1121 by Godfrey Count of Namur, and he seems to
have looked back in his later life with firm attachment
to his cloister life in that picturesque and venerable
abbey above the gliding Sambre. He was afterwards
removed to the more famous monastery of Lobes, which
had sent forth so many great men in the Middle Ages,
and there he contracted a lasting intimacy with
Raphael Baccart, afterwards its abbot.</p>

<p>Marchant was next transferred to the town of
Couvin, to the church of which he became pastor and
dean.</p>

<p>Jacques Marchant wrote his work, “The Garden of
Pastors,” at the instigation of his brother Peter, a
Franciscan, at one time Commissary and Visitor-General
of the Province of Britain, and afterwards Provincial
of that of Flanders.</p>

<p>The Dean of Couvin was a man of very remarkable
refinement of taste. His mind was eminently poetic,
and there is not a subject which he touched, over which
he has not cast a gleam of beauty. He handles his
matter with the utmost tenderness, yet he holds it with
the firm grasp of a theologian.</p>

<p>The glow of his fervent piety irradiates every page
of his writings, and invests them with that peculiar
charm which attaches to the works of the great mystic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
and spiritual writers of an earlier age. He is full of
holy reverence and godly fear: with him there is none
of that offensive trifling with sacred matters, none of
that profane prying into solemn mysteries, which disgraced
certain of the earlier preachers, who were only
eager to exhibit themselves as well versed in the
subtleties of the schools.</p>

<p>Marchant never approaches a sacred subject but with
veiled face and the bow of reverence; never does he
degenerate into buffoonery; “The wise man doth scarcely
smile a little,”—and the smile of our author is inexpressibly
sweet.</p>

<p>If St. Thomas Aquinas is to theology what Michael
Angelo was to art, then Jacques Marchant may take
his place beside Angelico of Fiesole.</p>

<p>And perhaps the reason of this spirituality is, that
the Dean drew from the purest wells of living water,
instead of letting down his pitcher in the polluted
cisterns of a pagan antiquity. Profoundly learned he
was not; his knowledge of the classics was but limited;—but
he was well versed in the writings of the great
Christian Fathers, and well trained in the science of the
Saints.</p>

<p>His pure and loving spirit seems to have panted, like
the hart, for the water-brooks of Divine wisdom, and
to have turned instinctively from the dry and sterile
land whither the men of his day were bending their
steps. Yes; he left the satyr to dance in the desolate
ruins of the olden world, that he might lie down in the
green pastures of the Christian faith.</p>

<p>It is certainly remarkable that, whereas in his day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
men affected to quote the classic writers of Rome and
Greece, and the study of these authors was reviving,
Marchant passes them almost completely over<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>. The
catalogue of his library I give, as it would be hard to
find one more judiciously selected.</p>

<p>His commentators on Holy Scripture, in addition to
the Fathers, are Jansenius, Titelmann, Jansonius Baradius,
Viegas, Salasas, Ribera, and Cornelius à Lapide.
His theological writers, after the great Thomas and
Cajetan, are Bellarmin, Suarez, Clarius, Torres, and
Malderus. The preachers whom he consults are Pepin,
Louis of Granada, Diez, Stella, Vega, Iachinus, Stapleton,
Osorius, Valderama<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>, Coster, Labata, and Carthagena.</p>

<p>His spiritual authors are Thomas à Kempis, Blosius,
Harphius, Platus, Aponte, Sales, Salo, Solutivo, Roderiguez,
Bruno, and Baldesanus.</p>

<p>His catechetical writers are Canisius, Somnius,
Fœlisius, Nider, Bayus, and Claude Thuet.</p>

<p>“And although,” says Marchant, “I may have
amassed stones, wood, and mortar from other sources
than my own field or quarry, in order that I might
erect this edifice, yet do not deny it to be mine, for it
is according to my own scheme; mine is the labour,
mine the skill, mine the hand which erected, disposed,
and consummated it. No one surely will deny that the
garden is his who possesses, digs, cultivates, arranges,
and adorns it, though he may have brought from elsewhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
some seeds, herbs, fruit-trees, and flowers, which
by pruning, lopping, and transplanting, he may have
sown or planted there. However, it is little to have
sown, planted, watered, and cultivated, unless there be
increase and fruit produced, all which comes, not of
human skill, but of God alone.</p>

<p>“I say, then, that the garden is not mine, but His
who worketh all in all, to whom I commend and reconsecrate
it with my whole heart, that He may give it
increase. And do thou use it happily, and pray for me.
Farewell.”</p>

<p>The Hortus Pastorum consists of four books; the first
treats of Faith, the second of Hope, the third of Charity,
the fourth of Justice—the four great streams springing
from one source which water the Eden of the Church.</p>

<p>Under the head of Faith, Marchant expounds the
Apostles’ Creed in seventeen tracts, each containing
several propositions and lections.</p>

<p>Under the head of Hope, he discusses prayer, and
especially the Lord’s Prayer and the Angelic Salutation.
In this book are five tracts.</p>

<p>Under the head of Charity, Marchant treats of the
Commandments, in four tracts.</p>

<p>The fourth book of the Hortus Pastorum has a separate
title, the Tuba Sacerdotalis, or the sevenfold blast
of the priestly trumpet laying low the walls of Jericho.</p>

<p>These walls of the city of palms are, according to
Marchant, the seven deadly sins, which he accordingly
treats of in seven tracts, each containing from nine to
ten lections.</p>

<p>In addition to the Hortus Pastorum and the Tuba<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Sacerdotalis, Marchant is the author of other works, a
list of which follows, together with the list of the different
editions of the Hortus.</p>

<p>The funeral orations are hardly likely to be much
read now, but the sermons on the Saints, published
under the title of Vitis florigera, are of value; they give
an outline of the life of each Saint, and a moral application
of the lesson inculcated by the Church in the
appointment of the festival. The Resolutiones pastorales<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
will be found exceedingly useful, as it contains solutions
of many difficulties which are likely to beset a parish
priest. The Candelabrum Mysticum is a very important
and useful practical exposition of the Sacraments, and the
Virga Aaronis florens, which is generally bound up with
the Hortus, is an admirable directory of priestly life, containing
godly admonitions and advice, under five heads
and thirteen lections, each lection representing a blossom
on Aaron’s rod, or a perfection in the sacerdotal life
to which every priest should labour to attain. At the
end of this work there is an interesting account of the
introduction and founding of a congregation of St.
Charles Boromeo (oblates), in the diocese of Leyden,
by the joint efforts of Marchant and his friends Stephen
Strecheus, Suffragan of Leyden, and John à Chokier,
Vicar-General. This congregation is a society of
secular Clergy constituted on much the same principles
as the Societies of the Oratorians and St. Philip Neri.
At this time, when associations for the advancement of
spiritual life are being formed in our own branch of
the Church, it would be well to consider whether the
rules of St. Charles might not be taken and adapted to
our modern exigencies, and so the congregation of
oblates be revived amongst ourselves.</p>

<p>But to return to the Shepherd’s Garden.</p>

<p>As a specimen of the manner in which Jacques
Marchant expounds a doctrine, I will give in outline
his exposition of the eleventh Article of the Creed—“The
Resurrection of the Body.”</p>

<p>Lection I. On the resurrection of the dead.</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>Proposition 1. Universal resurrection was announced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
in the Old and New Testaments; Christ
proves this from the words, <i>The God of Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob</i>, saying, <i>He is not the God
of the dead, but of the living</i>.</p>

<p class="not">For the Sadducees denied the existence of
angel or spirit, and a state of life after death.</p>

<p class="not">If God is God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
and He is God of the living, then these patriarchs
are in a state of existence after death.</p>

<p class="not">Christ quoted from Moses, and not from passages
in the prophets, because the Sadducees
accepted the Pentateuch only.</p>

<p class="not">Christ raised some from the dead as an earnest
of what He would do hereafter, as for instance,
Lazarus, the widow’s son, and the daughter of
Jairus.</p>

<p>Proposition 2. The resurrection of the body,
though naturally hard to be understood, is most
easy to be performed by God.</p>

<p class="not">The doctrine of the resurrection was unknown
to the philosophers.</p>

<p class="not">There are natural difficulties in the way,
yet it is possible with God, as illustrated by
the vision of Ezekiel (xvii.).</p>

<p class="not">Daniel also was promised the resurrection
(xii. 2).</p>

<p class="not">Marchant relates the story of the seven sleepers
as an illustration of the manner in which those
sleeping in their graves may awake in the flesh
and in the likeness of their former selves.</p>

<p class="not">Nature gives us figures and types of resurrection:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
the seeds decaying and springing
up again; the trees shedding their leaves to
burst again into leaf, and flower, and fruit;
the waning of the year to break again into
spring.</p>

<p class="not">If there is a difficulty in our conceiving how a
body scattered to the winds may be restored, take
a globule of quicksilver, shiver it into countless
minute particles, gather them again into your
palm, and lo! the globule is identical with that
which was before.</p>

<p>Proposition 3. This doctrine of a resurrection has
been the source of joy and consolation to saints
and martyrs in their afflictions.</p>

<p class="not">Example of Job. <i>I know that my Redeemer
liveth, and that He shall stand at the latter day
upon the earth: and though after my skin worms
destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God.</i>
(Job xix. 25, 26.)</p>

<p class="not">Example of the seven brethren (2 Macc. vii.).</p>

<p class="not">Examples of St. James and St. Nicasius.</p>

<p class="not">The Apostle asserts that if we had no such
hope <i>we should be of all men most miserable</i>, but we
have a hope of resurrection (Phil. iii. 20, 21).</p>

<p class="not">In like manner then as the husbandman (James
v.) waits unconcernedly for the time when his
seed sown in corruption shall spring up, so must
we not be saddened if these our corruptible bodies
waste and decay, but must commit them unto
the faithful Creator, remembering the words of
Habakkuk, <i>Rottenness entered into my bones, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the day of
trouble.… Yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will
joy in the God of my salvation. The Lord God is
my strength, and He will make my feet like hinds’
feet, and He will make me to walk upon mine high
places.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Lection II. Of the identity of the risen with the
present body.</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>Proposition 1. The two bodies are essentially <i>one</i>.
The resurrection is one of the flesh, not of the
soul only.</p>

<p class="not">It is a resurrection of substantial flesh, not
of an aerial phantom.</p>

<p class="not">Job distinctly says, <i>In my flesh shall I see God,
whom I shall see for myself and not another</i>; in
the same skin and flesh, not in other skin and
flesh; with the same eyes.</p>

<p class="not">Example of Eutychius of Constantinople confessing
this truth when dying.</p>

<p>Corollary. From this we see what dignity belongs
to the human body, with what reverence man
should treat it, and how it is worthy to be
guarded carefully by angels (Jude 9).</p>

<p>Proposition 2. Although the risen body is identical
with the natural body in substance, yet
it differs from it in accidents. For the risen
body has four dowers—</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>1. Impassibility, or incapacity for suffering
pain, disease, or corruption.</p>

<p>2. Glory, being made resplendent as the sun,
after the fashion of Christ’s transfiguration</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>3. Agility, or capacity for following every
impulse of the will.</p>

<p>4. Subtlety, or capacity for penetrating every
where.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Of these four conditions of the body the Apostle
speaks (1 Cor. xv. 42-44), <i>It is sown in corruption,
it is raised in incorruption</i> (impassible); <i>it is
sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory; it is sown
in weakness, it is raised in power</i> (agile); <i>it is
sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual</i> (subtle)
<i>body</i>.</p>

<p class="not">St. Paul takes the figure of a grain of corn,
which is sown in corruption, decaying in the
earth, but rises in incorruption; and shows that
in like manner will the body rise free from corruption.</p>

<p class="not">The body is sown in dishonour; however noble
and illustrious it may have been in life, it becomes
an object of loathing in the tomb; but it
will be raised glorious, radiating light.</p>

<p class="not">The body sown in weakness, unable to resist
the attack of decay and the worm, will be
vigorous and free on the Resurrection morn,
capable of performing any act which the mind
can devise.</p>

<p class="not">The body sown an animal or natural body,
subject to vegetative processes, and other conditions
of nature, at the Resurrection will be free
from all these conditions.</p>

<p>Proposition 3. Bodies here deformed, will hereafter
be perfected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p class="not">Marchant reasons that, in a state of perfection,
all imperfection, and therefore all deformity, will
be done away.</p>

<p class="not">He discusses the question of the age to which
all bodies will seem to have attained at the
Resurrection; the received doctrine being that
<i>we</i> shall <i>all come … unto a perfect man, unto
the measure of the stature</i> (marg. <i>age</i>) <i>of the fulness
of Christ</i>. (Eph. iv. 13.)</p>

</div>

<p>Lection III. The circumstances of the resurrection.</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>Proposition 1. The trumpet call precedes it.</p>

<p class="not">For it takes place <i>in a moment, in the twinkling
of an eye, at the last trump</i>—that trump being the
voice of the archangel. (1 Thess. iv. 16. Matt.
xxiv. 31.)</p>

<p class="not">The trumpet of old called to a solemn assembly;
it was a sign of advance, it was a signal of
battle. So will the last trump <i>call the Heaven
from above and the earth, that God may judge His
people</i>; it will be the sign of advance to the elect
into their kingdom, it will be the signal for all
creation to arm itself to fight against the ungodly.</p>

<p class="not">Do you ask what is the object of the trumpet
blast?</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>1st. It is to call the angels together, to prepare
for the severance of good and bad.</p>

<p>2nd. It is to wake the dead.</p>

<p>3rd. It is to summon the elect to the feast of
good things in Heaven.</p>

<p>4th. It is to terrify the wicked and announce
to them their doom.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>Proposition 2. The locality of the resurrection is
uncertain.</p>

<p class="not">It is supposed by many that it will take place
in the Valley of Jehoshaphat, where good and
bad will be gathered together. Others suppose
that the good and bad will be gathered in
separate spots. Others again suppose that each
individual will remain by the grave whence he
has arisen.</p>

<p>Proposition 3. The time when the resurrection will
take place is also uncertain.</p>

<p class="not">Some think it will take place early on Easter
Day, <i>at the rising of the sun</i>, that our resurrection
may be made in all points like that of our
great Head. Others think that it will take place
suddenly at night: <i>At midnight there was a voice
heard, Behold, the Bridegroom cometh; go ye out
to meet Him</i>. The type of Israel coming out of
Egypt points also to midnight.</p>

<p class="not">But the place and the time knoweth no man,
they depend on the Providence of God.</p>

</div>

<p>I confess to feeling quite at a loss what to select as a
specimen of Marchant’s refined and beautiful writing.
Every page contains beauties, and it is hard to choose
among them.</p>

<p>The following is very tender. After quoting the
text, <i>My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among
ten thousand</i> (Cant. v. 10), he breaks forth into the
following passage: “White is my Beloved in His
purity and His innocence, but ruddy in His burning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
charity, through which He shed His blood. White
is He in His nativity, girded about with virgin flesh,
but ruddy in His circumcision, sprinkled with His gore.
White at the transfiguration, in His glistering raiment,
ruddy on the Mount of Olives, bleeding in His sweat.
White is He in the palace of Herod, dressed in the
white robe, ruddy in that of Pilate in the purple
garment. White upon the Cross, in the water which
flowed from His side, but ruddy, bathed wholly in His
Blood. White is He in the Sacrament, under the species
of bread, ruddy under the veil of wine. White in His
mercy, ruddy in His justice; white in His Body mystical,
in the virgins, but ruddy in the purpled martyrs.” (114.)</p>

<p>“<i>He is the chiefest among ten thousand</i>, through His
passion exalted above all creatures and above all glory
of the elect.</p>

<p>“The chiefest among ten thousand, as leader of His
people Israel to the Promised Land, by the pillar,
the rod, and the Red Sea; the pillar, forsooth, at
which He was scourged, the rod of His Cross, and
the Red Sea of His Blood.</p>

<p>“The chiefest among ten thousand, as the great High
Priest entering into the holiest of all with His own blood.</p>

<p>“The chiefest among ten thousand, as the Mediator
between God and man, ever presenting before the
Father those wounds by which He was constituted
Mediator.</p>

<p>“The chiefest among ten thousand, as the Shepherd
of either fold, that of Jew and that of Gentile; by the
pastoral staff of His Cross reducing them into one fold
under one Shepherd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>“The chiefest among ten thousand, as Head of the
militant and triumphant Church.</p>

<p>“The chiefest among ten thousand, as Head and
King of angels and men, of both making one society,
one kingdom.</p>

<p>“The chiefest among ten thousand, as the Judge of
living and dead.” (110.)</p>

<p>I make no apology for translating, almost entire, the
following exquisite passage on the wound in our Lord’s
side, so redolent with spiritual fragrance, so rapturous
in heavenly ardour:—</p>

<p>“Not only ought the dove to dwell in the clefts of the
rock, but she should also flee to the <i>cavernam maceriæ</i>
(English vers., ‘secret places of the stairs’): that is,
the wound in the side.… There make thy nest, and
enter, O dove! therein lurk many mysteries: for why
was that side opened?</p>

<p>“First, that thou mightest enter the ark with the
olive-bough, the symbol of peace. Lo! Christ is the
ark, and the wound in His side is the window of
the ark through which thou mayest enter; for as
the dove found not rest for the sole of her foot, so
dost thou wander in vain with the raven, and wheel
around the corpses of this world; thou canst not find thy
rest, save in the heart of thy Saviour. There has He
chosen to build thee a home; there, in that heart burning
with love, to plant thee a flowery Paradise, in which
thou mayest delight, and exclaim, <i>It is good for us to
be here</i>. ‘How good!’ says Bernard, ‘how good to
dwell in that heart, in that dug field!’ O Lord, Thy
heart is a good treasure, for which I will surrender all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
my fancies, all the desires of my mind. I will acquire
it for myself, casting all my thoughts into Thy heart;
and I will worship toward this ark of the covenant, and
praise the name of the Lord.…</p>

<p>“If then at any time thou feelest want and lukewarmness,
or dryness, then turn thy heart to the Lord, turn
to the heart of thy Lord; seek it on the cross, His couch
of love. There wilt thou find the way to His very heart
open; by that broad gate of His side, by that door of
piety, thou mayest enter. There join heart to heart,
that thou mayest become partaker of light, of life, of
flame, and of that peace which <i>He shall speak unto His
people, and to His saints, that they turn not again</i>.</p>

<p>“Secondly, He chose that His side should be opened,
because to the Redeemer it was not enough that His
whole body was bloody with the rods, that His hands
and feet were purpled by the nails, but He desired to
shed forth, by the spear, as token of His unbounded
love, that blood which still lingered about the heart,
and which neither thorns nor scourge had extracted.
Wherefore He was wounded, not so much by the
spear, as by love, or if you prefer it, by both the
lance and love. Whence it is said twice, <i>Thou hast
wounded My heart, My sister, My spouse; thou hast
wounded My heart!</i> And do thou reply, ‘Wound
Thou my heart, my Bridegroom; wound Thou my
heart! wound it with compassion, wound it with love;
with these twin arrows from Thy bow pierce through my
heart. Twice did Moses smite the rock, twice do Thou
smite this stony heart, that from it may stream, if not
blood, yet bitter tears.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thirdly, He chose to show us the place of our regeneration.
Hence there flowed forth both water and
blood, signs of Baptism and the Eucharist, which regenerate
us to God. And thus is it said, <i>Thy daughters
shall be nursed at Thy side</i> (Isa. lx. 4), O Christ! for
Thou regeneratest us by the blood and water streaming
from Thy side.</p>

<p>“Fourthly, consider that, although the lance gave no
pain to the Saviour, yet was it keen, for it wounded
with cruel pang the heart of the Mother. For her
heart was bound up with the heart of her Son; and to
this the prophet seems to refer when he says, <i>Supra
dolorem vulnerum meorum addiderunt</i>. (Ps. lxix. 27.)
But in conclusion, I repeat—Arise, O dove! enter in,
O love! for here is the door by which thou shalt pass
to the marriage-feast of thy Bridegroom; for here is
the window of love which desires to enkindle thee
also; for here is the furnace streaming forth with
mercy. Gathering together all thy evil affections,
thy sins, thy negligences, cast them into that furnace
of love, that there they may be consumed. There exclaim
with Thomas, <i>My Lord, and my God!</i> and with
the Psalmist, <i>This shall be my rest for ever; here will
I dwell, for I have a delight therein</i>. For there is the
place to live, there is the place to die.”</p>

<p>In like manner does Marchant exclaim: “Spare,
O cruel nails, O spare those sacred feet, which have
never walked in the way of sinners. Come rather and
pierce my heart; pierce my hard heart with the piercing
of penitence, that ye may draw from it the salty tears
of contrition; for, from the time when ye were sprinkled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
with the Saviour’s blood, ye have had power to heal the
wounds of the mind.</p>

<p>“Yet would not the Saviour spare Himself these nails,
that He might make satisfaction for all offences committed
by our feet walking in the way of sinners, when
we went astray like the lost sheep; and that He might
merit by this price and these pangs to guide our feet
into the way of peace.</p>

<p>“It was not sufficient for Him to have endured so
much labour, sweat, and weariness, whilst seeking
His wandering sheep; but He desired also that His
feet should at length be pierced, not with the thorns
only, but also with the nails.”</p>

<p>On the words, <i>He stood in the midst of them</i>, he
remarks: “There then were the disciples gathered in
terror, in error, all had lost their faith, all wavered,
doubting of the resurrection. All, the Virgin excepted,
had lost the light of faith, as is represented by the
Church in her Office for Holy Week (i. e. Tenebræ),
when fifteen candles are extinguished, one alone being
excepted and allowed to remain alight. This indicates
the eleven Apostles with the three women losing the light
of faith, which remained in the Virgin alone, of whom it
might truly be said, <i>Her candle goeth not out by night</i>.
These, then, being gathered together, Christ was present
in the midst, though the doors were shut; for just as
He issued from the Virgin’s womb leaving her still
virgin, as He passed through the unmoved stone of the
sepulchre, so now did He enter to His disciples without
impediment, for nothing can hinder the transit of a
glorious body: <i>He stood in the midst of them!</i> Stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
as a pastor in the midst of his flock, gathering them to
him; as a leader in the midst of his soldiers, encouraging
them; as the sun in the midst of the stars,
illumining them; as the heart in the midst of the
body, vivifying it; as the tree of life in the midst of
Paradise amongst the elect trees; as the candlestick in
the midst of the house, lighting it and dispelling its
gloom; as the column in the midst of the building,
sustaining it.</p>

<p>“And this word <i>stood</i> has its special significance,
denoting the resurrection. For before the resurrection,
when He bore the burden of our sins, He is described
as at one time lying in the manger, at another
as seated weary by the well, and then as prostrate with
His face to the earth praying, upon the mountain, or as
bowed down and crying to the Father in the garden, or
again as stooping under the weight of the cross as He
ascended Calvary, whilst on the cross itself He is
spoken of as bowing His head to give up the ghost.
All which attitudes of the body denote the weight of
our sins with which He was burdened. But now, that
burden is shaken off in His resurrection, for He has
drowned it in the abyss of His blood, and so rightly is
He spoken of as <i>standing</i> in the midst.”</p>

<p>Jacques Marchant thus paraphrases the 110th Psalm:
“At the ascension it was said unto Him, <i>Sit Thou on
My right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool</i>.
That is, Do Thou, who art exalted above all
creatures, share with Me My kingdom until all Thine
enemies are subjected unto Thee, till the kingdom of
the predestinate is filled, and Thy victory has attained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
to its perfection. And here by the fulfilling of the
kingdom of predestination, and the conquering of foes,
and the extension of empire, this is signified, that in
the consummation of the age, He will return again into
the world, that the subjection of every thing to Him
may be made manifest in all the world. Wherefore
the Psalmist adds, <i>The Lord shall send the rod of
Thy power out of Sion: be Thou ruler, even in the midst
among Thine enemies</i>. That is, the sceptre of Thy
royal power, the sceptre of strength, shalt Thou begin
to extend and pass on from the city and mount of
Sion, even unto the ends of the earth, by Thy Apostolic
messengers; so that Thou mayest rule even in the
midst of Thy enemies and false brethren, Jews, heathen,
and heretics. In the end of the age, however, Thy kingdom
will be exalted perfectly over Thine enemies, when
Thou shalt send forth the sceptre of virtue, the banner
of Thy cross out of the Heavenly Sion, that Thy foes
may be entirely subjected beneath Thy feet. Then he
adds: <i>In the day of Thy power shall the people offer Thee
freewill offerings with an holy worship</i>, when the kingdom
will be Thine, and Thine the only principality.”
The Vulgate varies so much from our English Version
in this third verse, that Marchant’s paraphrase cannot
apply to it, and I shall therefore pass on to the fifth
verse: “<i>The Lord upon Thy right hand shall wound
even kings in the day of His wrath</i>. Christ our Lord
sitting at Thy right hand shall break all the power of
kings who have persecuted the Church. Then shall
the Neroes, Maximinians, and Deciuses be thrust down
into hell. <i>He shall judge among the heathen; He shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
fill the places with the dead bodies</i>: He shall then exercise
judgment over all nations, and, having condemned
the wicked, shall perfect and consummate their
last extermination. Then shall the <i>places</i> of hell be
filled with impious men, and with devils thrust down
thither and there enclosed; and that because <i>He shall
smite in sunder the heads over divers countries</i>, breaking
down the proud, and bringing them into confusion
before all the world.</p>

<p>“And would you know why He is given such power
to judge the nations and trample upon kings and
haughty men? <i>He shall drink of the brook in the
way: therefore shall He lift up His head.</i> Because, forsooth,
in this way and mortal life, which glides by as
a brook, He drank the turbid water, bearing our infirmities,
by His Passion descending into the very depths
of the stream; therefore, because of this so great humility,
hath God highly exalted Him, making Him the
Judge of all.</p>

<p>“If indeed in His first Advent it was cried, <i>Blessed
is He that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna
in the highest!</i> how much more in that His second
triumphal coming will it be cried by angels, by the
elect, by kings, by priests, by people, by children, ay!
by all creatures, <i>Let the Heavens rejoice, and let the
earth be glad: let the sea make a noise, and all that
therein is. Let the field be joyful, and all that is in it;
then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice before the Lord,
for He cometh, for He cometh, to judge the earth.</i></p>

<p>“We too, considering that time of triumph, shall exclaim
to our King and Saviour with glad accord, ‘Reign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
even in the midst among Thine enemies! Reign, Thou
Son of David, setting up Thy throne above all monarchs!
Reign, Thou peaceful King, trampling under foot all the
kingdom of Satan! Reign, Thou Son of Mary, in the
midst of heretics and blasphemers! Reign, Thou Galilæan,
in the midst of infidels once rebels! Reign, Thou
Nazarene, in the midst of Julians and persecutors!
Reign, Thou innocent Lamb, in the midst of ravening
wolves! Reign, Thou Lamb which was slain, in the
midst of angels and all the elect!’ <i>I heard the voice
of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and
the elders, saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb
that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and
strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing. And every
creature which is in Heaven, and on earth, and under the
earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them,
heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power,
be unto Him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the
Lamb for ever and ever.</i>”</p>

<h2 id="JOHN_OSORIUS">JOHN OSORIUS.</h2>

<p>John Osorius, a Spaniard of the diocese of Burgos,
entered the novitiate of the Society of Jesus in 1558,
at the early age of sixteen. He taught moral theology,
but gave himself up more especially to preaching, his
talents in that line soon manifesting themselves. He
preached often before the Court, and was selected to deliver
orations on various public occasions. For instance,
he preached twice at the fitting out of the Armada, and
again on its discomfiture. His three sermons, entitled
<i>Cum nostri redirent ab Anglia re infecta</i>, will be found in
the fourth volume of his collected sermons. He was
select preacher on the anniversary of the death of St.
Ignatius Loyola, the founder of his order, and also on
the occasion of the death of the king. He died at Medina,
aged fifty-two, in the year 1594.</p>

<p>His sermons have been published several times.</p>

<p>John Osorius was a preacher of a high order. He
was eminently Scriptural, and thoroughly practical. He
neither wasted his efforts on the discussion of profitless
school questions, nor wearied his hearers by abstruse
disquisitions on points of Canon law. His matter is
always solid, and his method sound and clear. A man
of refined taste and lively imagination, he could render
his discourses attractive to both educated and uneducated.
He seldom breaks into a torrent of eloquence,
like De Barzia, but his style is polished and graceful.
He had none of the fire of the Bishop of Cadiz, but in
his heart burned the pure flame of a tempered zeal, not
raging forth as a furnace, dazzling and scorching all
around, but calmly glowing in unruffled peace, unnoticed
perhaps in the glare of day, but steadily beaming
as a guiding star to the wanderer in the night.</p>

<p>In one point he certainly resembles his countryman
De Barzia, viz. in his accurate Biblical knowledge.
But the use he made of Scripture was different to that
made by the Bishop, as his audience was very different
from that to which the Prelate addressed his Mission
Sermons. Holy Scripture was the spiritual food of this
Jesuit preacher, and his discourses prove his intimate
acquaintance with every portion of God’s Word. His
discourses do not contain, as do so many modern sermons,
crude and undigested lumps of Scripture, clumsily
pieced and awkwardly inserted to distend the dull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
oration to its conventional limits, but the words of
Inspiration float lightly and fragrantly on the stream
of simple eloquence, as strands of new-mown grass and
cut meadow flowers on the calm brook which softly
glides past the field where the mowers mow the hay.</p>

<p>If De Barzia roused long-dead consciences, waking
them from their sepulchres with note like a trumpet,
bringing them forth bound hand and foot in the corpse-clothes
of evil habits, and delivering them over to the
confessors to be loosed and let go, Osorius quickened
the consciences but just dead, with still small voice,
taking them as it were by the hand and lifting them
up with tenderness, that he might restore them to their
parents—to their God, who was to them a Father, to the
Church, which was to them a Mother.</p>

<p>But with all these rare merits, Osorius had his defects.
His sermons are wanting in arrangement and in
unity of design. He preached on the Gospel for the day,
and aimed rather at giving a running commentary on
the selected passage of Scripture, than at elaborating one
text and concentrating his powers upon its application.
Hence, each of his sermons, which are very long, may well
be broken into six or eight short discourses with separate
points, but when preached in their entirety the effect
is that of a surfeit. Nothing can be better than the
food he provides, but it is in too great abundance, and
it is too varied; briefly, in his sermons there is what the
French call an <i>embarras de richesses</i>.</p>

<p>There is this excuse to be made for Osorius, that he
did but follow in the wake of the Patristic and Mediæval
preachers, whose public orations consisted almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
invariably of Scripture expositions, partaking more of
the character of our modern Bible-class lectures than
our set sermons; and it was only bold men like De
Barzia, who set all conventionalities at defiance, that
originated the class of sermon now recognized as the
normal type of a pulpit discourse. Osorius, however,
could divest himself of the trammels of custom when he
chose, and he has left some notable specimens of sermons
which have but one point and subject, in his
fourth volume; and I very much question whether any
more noble and more vigorous have ever been composed
than those written by John Osorius, the Jesuit,
on the Four Last Things, the Three Foes of Man, and
the Seven Last Words.</p>

<p>Osorius seldom relates anecdotes, and his sermons are
almost entirely free from those stories which preachers
of his age delighted in introducing to illustrate their
subjects; but, in their place, he brings forward similes
to an extraordinary extent. His sermons are studded
with them, and his similes are almost invariably graceful
and neat. It may be questioned whether he does
not somewhat overdo it, when one sermon contains
fifteen similes. Yet these are so beautiful that we could
ill spare one. Perhaps we are too critical in requiring
all sermons to be cut to the same shape; perhaps the
beauty of the wood hyacinth may consist in the multitude
of its azure bells, and the splendour of the tulip
would be lost if it grew in a bunch.</p>

<p>But the reader shall judge for himself. I will give
him a string of similes from the Trinity sermons of
Osorius.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>“Aristotle says that as the sun, most visible in itself,
cannot be contemplated without difficulty by our eyes,
on account of their weakness; so God, of supreme entity
and perfection, can hardly be grasped by us, through
the imperfection of our intellect.”</p>

<p>“<i>When my father and mother forsake me, the Lord
taketh me up</i>, says the Psalmist; and Israel exclaimed,
<i>Make us gods to go before us</i>. For without God we
have not power to advance. What will he say to this,
who enters on a state of life without God to lead him,
who undertakes hard matters forgetful of God? As
the ivy trails along the earth when it finds not a tree,
to which it may cling and by which it may ascend,
so does the soul lie prostrate till it has found God, to
whom it may cling as to its beloved; and having found
Him, by Him ascend, <i>going on from grace to grace</i>.”</p>

<p>“<i>The Heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament
showeth His handiwork</i>: they all point wondrously
to their Creator, showing themselves to be creatures
fashioned by His hands.</p>

<p>“Cicero observes: If when travelling you came suddenly
in a desert upon some magnificent palace, such
as that of Solomon, and were to ask how it came thither,
and the answer were made that a mountain had fallen,
and that its ruins had shaped themselves, somehow, into
this great mansion, you would laugh them to scorn
who asserted this, for the house shows plainly the
handiwork of an artificer—and that he was a famous
artificer to boot—who thus ranged all in such perfect
order, and this, you would say, was self-evident. So,
too, he who considers the workmanship of this world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
with attention,—the garden of earth, the abyss of sea, the
heavens wondrously adorned, the variety of stars, their
varied and yet harmonious motions,—he will say that it
is manifest that some master artificer has arranged
them, and that their conjunction cannot be fortuitous.”</p>

<p>“Look first at the beauteous image of the soul, and
gather from it that it has a divine artificer. If you saw
a boy holding a charming image in his hand, and you
asked him, Whose is this image? who fashioned it?
if he were to reply, I made it; you would at once say,
That is not true, for it is a masterpiece of art. So, too,
the wondrous power of our souls, and their wondrous
perfection, point to a Heavenly artificer.”</p>

<p>“Who, then, is God? He is One and Three: one in
nature, one in wisdom, one in goodness; but three in
Person: Three Persons but One God, one wise, one
powerful, one good.</p>

<p>“How then three Persons and not three Gods? I and
thou are two persons, but one in nature and species.</p>

<p>“How two persons with one nature? Because in me
there is that which is not in thee, and this constitutes
difference in personality.</p>

<p>“But thou sayest, What is there in the Father which
is not in the Son?</p>

<p>“That thou mayest understand, take this illustration.</p>

<p>“I have invented a science, entirely of myself; this
science I teach thee; thou and I communicate it to a
third. The same science is in all three; one of us
knows nothing which the other knows not; one knows
as much as all the three. Yet is there this difference
between us, I have the knowledge of myself, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
received it of none; in thee it is derived from me; in
the third it proceeds from thee and me. Now suppose
that, instead of a science, this were my nature which I
gave to thee, and which we two communicated to the
third; then should we three be one in nature, and yet
with the diversity I have specified.</p>

<p>“Thus, as I have said, is it with our God, in whom
it is the same to be, to know, to be able, &amp;c. This
wisdom and nature is in the Father self-derived, received
of none. It is in the Son also, the same, but
received by intelligence from the Father. It is in the
Holy Ghost, but proceeding from the Father and the
Son by love: therefore the Persons are three, but there
are not three Gods nor three Lords, for the nature, and
the wisdom, and the power, and the goodness are one,
but in three Persons; therefore there is but one God,
one Lord, one Wise.”</p>

<p>“God is the abyss of being, as signifies His name
Jehovah; in Him are all perfections, of which perfections
each is infinite, all are One. What then is my
God? Ask every creature, and let them show you their
God, and tell you what He is; not that each can declare
Him perfectly, but each in part. Does it not happen
to you sometimes, as you walk abroad, that you light
upon a brook, and say, I will trace it to its source,
and see whence this streamlet flows? Do you now
act thus, and you will attain to your God. Mark what
is good in the creatures you behold, in the song of
birds, in the beauty of flowers, in the wealth of metals,
in the sweetness of meats; these are but rills proceeding
from God the abounding Fount; all these utter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the things which are in God; for all creatures are but
voices manifesting Him.”</p>

<p>Yet we must not rest in them. “It has happened
that painters have pictured fruit with such accuracy
that birds have come out of the sky thinking them
real, in order to feed upon them; but finding them
to be painted, and that there is no food in them, they
fly away to seek their true sustenance. The Divine
painter has traced with His brush in His creatures the
beauties which live in Himself, and in them they seem
to live. Yet are they but figures, not verities, <i>for the
fashion of this world passeth away</i>. Would you know
how to act, knowing that these are but pictures and
not realities? Act as the bird, which finding no food
in the painting seeks its real meat elsewhere. Mark
this, you will find in creation no true food, no satiety,
no repose; mark this and fly away to your God, He
is very good, He is true food, in Him alone is repose.”</p>

<p>“When you hear sweet harmony, you say, I hear
musicians, though you see them not; so seeing the
harmony of creation, acknowledge God its source.
In God are all perfections. Take the opal. Look at
it fixedly from one point; it is white as snow, and
you see nought save whiteness in it. Turn a little
aside; it flashes out in flames as a carbuncle. Look
from another point, it glows a rich crimson as the
ruby; again, from another point it is all green as
the emerald. Lo! you have an image of God, that
most precious gem, to win which we must sell all we
have. He is one, yet manifold. Moses beheld God,
and He was to him like to the carbuncle, a burning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
fire: <i>The Lord thy God is a consuming fire</i>. That same
God did David behold: <i>The Lord is full of compassion
and mercy: long-suffering and of great goodness</i>. To
him then was He not all white? Isaiah beheld him:
<i>Wherefore art Thou red in Thine apparel?</i> and seeing
Him executing vengeance, He was like to the ruby.
John beheld Him, and <i>a rainbow round about the throne,
in sight like unto an emerald</i>. Lo! what variety, and
yet what unity!”</p>

<p>One of the most curious ideas of Osorius is the
following. He says that as he lies in bed he hears
the stroke, stroke, of his heart; and it sounds to him
as though within were two wood-cutters engaged night
and day in hewing down a tree. Nor am I wrong
in thinking so, he continues, for Flux and Reflux are
engaged every hour in laying their axes to the root of
the tree of life. In another sermon he speaks of men
fretting over the loss of worldly goods and neglecting
their eternal inheritance as resembling the little boy
who has built a mud castle, and who weeps when a
passer-by overthrows it with his foot, though he cares
nothing that a lawsuit is going on at the time by
which a large inheritance is being wrested from him.</p>

<p>The following is singularly beautiful, to my mind.
Osorius is speaking of the dower Christ has given to
His Church. He says, that as when a traveller marries
a wife in a far country he gives her a few presents,
but says to her, O my beloved, when we come home
to my own country, where all my wealth and property
are, then you shall have ten thousand times better
presents; so does Christ act with His Church. Here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
in the <i>far country</i> of this earth, He gives her a few gifts
and graces, but when He leads her home to His
heavenly habitation, He will crown her with endless
glory.</p>

<p>On the subject of the Ascension, he observes, very
gracefully, that when a fleet is tossing on the sea, if
one vessel enters the port in safety, the others pluck
up courage to follow. When the soldiers see their
leader mount the wall of the besieged city, they, though
below, are stirred to press onward too.</p>

<p>And again, speaking of Christ resuming His seat in
Heaven, he says that when a costly gem is given to a
king, he sets it in a golden ring, which is exquisitely
wrought, and which seemed a miracle of perfection
before the insertion of the gem. But when the jewel
is set, its glory eclipses all the graving of the ring.
So was Heaven beauteous without Christ, beauteous as
the setting, but now the precious gem, for whom all
was made, is again in His place, and eclipses all other
glories in His own effulgent beauty.</p>

<p>“The joy of Heaven must have been great, and the
cause of the joy is manifest. Heaven has received its
sun, enlightening it more than all its stars. It has
gotten its precious gem adorning that ring of eternity
more than its fine gold, more than all the comely forms
thereon engraved. But, earth, how canst thou rejoice
this day, deprived of the sun which late illumined
thee? When the sun shines in this hemisphere, all
things rejoice receiving light from it; but when it
retires to the other hemisphere, those things which are
in it begin their rejoicing, whilst those which are in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
ours are veiled in darkness, and droop in gloom and
tears. When the ark of God was brought to Bethshemesh,
that is, the house of the sun, the calves of the
cows which drew it were shut up at home, and they
lowed because the mothers which gave them milk were
away. This day is the ark of God, which has been
held captive in the house of this world, brought back
into Heaven, the true house of the sun. And we, as
the calves, remaining shut up in this world’s tabernacle,
without our nourishment from the breast and wounds
of Christ, how shall we do otherwise than low and
lament?”</p>

<p>This beautiful and quaint passage will show how
Osorius finds illustration in Scripture. I translate a
few more specimens of his style.</p>

<p>“<i>Behold how He loved him.</i> St. Thomas explains
this passage admirably when he says, quoting the
wise man, <i>Nothing doth countervail a faithful friend,
and his excellency is invaluable</i>, for a faithful friend is
worthy of love: and yet, <i>a faithful man who can find</i>?
He is a faithful friend who is stable in friendship; not
forgetting a first friend when a new one arrives, nor
when exalted in prosperity forgetful of the friend in
poverty, nor despising the friend who is cast down.</p>

<p>“God will be found the most faithful friend, in that
He never forgets former friends for the sake of new
ones; but those whom He chose before time was, these
will He love in eternity, when time is no more.
Neither does the addition of new friends make the
former less the friends of God, but rather the more
grateful is it to Him that many should love Him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Nor is Christ like the chief butler, who, when things
went well with him, forgot Joseph; but <i>though the Lord
be high, yet hath He respect unto the lowly</i>. Christ,
when mortal, chose men to be His friends; when made
immortal, He called them His brethren. <i>Go to My
brethren, and say unto them</i>, &amp;c. (John xx. 17). Nor
is the friendship of Christ capable of change through
loss of the friend, as is evident from the eleventh
chapter of St. John. <i>Now Jesus loved Martha, and her
sister, and Lazarus</i>, when they were hale and sound.
But what will He do when Lazarus is sick? <i>Lord,
behold he whom Thou lovest is sick</i>; He ceases not to love
because His friend is sick. Lazarus dies, the misery
increases, but friendship does not decrease; for He
says, <i>Our friend Lazarus sleepeth</i>. Lazarus is not
called friend because that he loves, but because he is
still beloved. Now Lazarus stinketh, and still Christ
is his friend, for He weepeth because of him. <i>Behold</i>,
they say, <i>how He loved him</i>! Ill, O multitude, do you
speak! to Him love is present, therefore rather say,
Behold how He loveth him! O most faithful Friend,
Thou art He who sayest, <i>I have loved thee with an
everlasting love</i>!</p>

<p>“Far otherwise are we toward Christ. He is in bonds,
and lo! Peter swears that he knows Him not. O
man! if you seek a true friend, seek first Christ, who
changeth not. What think you is the friendship of
the world? What the friendship of the flesh? You
have three friends. You are in peril, for you are summoned
before the king to be tried, and sentenced for
high treason. You go to your first friend, and tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
him your danger, and ask of him assistance. He
replies that he will accompany you as far as the
judgment hall, and leave you there. ‘Do you settle
your affair with the king; I can do no more for you.’
Seeing that there is no help to be gotten from this
friend, you turn to the second, and ask of him succour.
He replies, ‘When you are executed, I will wrap your
body in some old and cast-off linen, for a shroud.’
You go to the third, and he says, ‘I will be your
advocate. I will assist you, and will liberate you. I
will pacify the king, and, if need be, I will die in your
room.’ Is not this a faithful friend? Now those who
enter into compact of friendship with their flesh,
which of these friends have they got? The first,
which will accompany you only to the gate of death.
Cherish the flesh, love it, and it will be a Delilah to
you, handing you over to your enemies, leaving your
soul before the Judge, without accompanying it. The
world resembles the second friend, to please which you
must torture yourself, but all it will give you in the
end will be the shroud to enwrap your dead body.
But Christ is the third friend, the faithful one, our
advocate, who, to liberate us, endured death for us; He
who accompanies us to the judgment, who frees us,
who protects us! Let Him be our friend who truly
loves us. <i>We love God because He first loved us.</i>”</p>

<p>I conclude with the following striking passage:—</p>

<p>“<i>Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of?</i>
Being desirous of alluring His disciples to drink of the
cup, He expounds to them its sweetness, when He says
that He will drink of it first. And, in sooth, if we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
faithful to God, this reason would be sufficient to make
us drink it readily. But, as says the wise man, <i>most
men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a
faithful man who can find</i>? There is not a son, there
is not a servant, who acts as faithlessly with his father
or his master as we act towards God. Would you
know that of a certainty? I tell you be loth to sin,
be ready to die rather than sin.</p>

<p>“Ah! but you say, I like to sin. I ask you, Upon
what grounds do you persist in sinning? Well, you
say, God is so good; He loves me, He is ready to
pardon. So this is the reason why you continue in
sin! And what though you know this for certain,
where is your fidelity? where is your Christian honour?
Does a wife act in this manner with her husband? a son
with his father? a servant with his lord? I pray you
bid your wife act in this manner towards you. Say to
her, ‘Be chaste.’ She will say, ‘That is no concern of
mine. I know full well that you are good, that you
love me, and that if I were an adulteress you would
pardon me.’ And if it were so, would this answer of
your wife gratify you? Why! where would be the
honour of a good woman? where her fidelity? Would
it be deemed sufficient by you, if she were an adulteress
and were reconciled to her husband? Does any minister
act thus? You say to the royal minister, ‘Beware lest
thou plot treason against your master.’ He replies, ‘He
is an excellent king; he loves me, he will most certainly
pardon me even if I do turn traitor.’ O vilest of men!
O man truly without honour! where is the fidelity
which you owe to your monarch?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>“Vilest Christian of the household of Faith, unfaithful
and destitute of honour! how continue to sin? how do
you still commit adultery against God? how are you so
traitorous to your King? You say: He will pardon me.
Be it so. Yet where is your fidelity? where your
honour? Is it sufficient to be reconciled, to be a
pardoned traitor? Is it not far better to be able to
say, I never was a traitor?</p>

<p>“Now let us turn to the subject. If we are faithful
servants of God, enough for us that He has said, <i>The cup
that I shall drink of</i>, to make us thirst for that cup. He
drank thereof before thee; wilt thou not quaff of it out
of love for Him? Is there a faithful soldier who would
see his sovereign enter the battle, and fight amongst the
foe, and withdraw himself, leaving his king alone, and
betake himself to his sports? Hear what Uriah said,
<i>The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and my
lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in
the open fields; shall I then go into mine house?</i> How
different also she who said, <i>My Beloved is mine, and I am
His</i>. Bernard says, ‘In no other way can man respond
to his God in these same words, except by love, and by
drinking of the cup.’ God gives thee gifts; thou canst
give Him nothing. <i>I will take no bullock out of thine
house.</i> God beatifies thee; thou canst not beatify Him,
except by love and suffering. God loves thee; love
Him thou canst. He suffered for thee; suffer for Him
thou canst. Thus mayest thou render unto Him what
thou hast received of Him, and return, as it were, like
for like to thy God.”</p>

<h2 id="MAXIMILIAN_DEZA">MAXIMILIAN DEZA.</h2>

<p>Maximilian Deza, an Italian, was born in 1610, and
joined the Congregation of the Mother of God, in
which he soon became famous as a preacher. He seems
to have been a man of fervent piety and Apostolic zeal.
He had acquired a good knowledge of the Latin classics
in his early years, and this he was fond of exhibiting,
with some pedantry, in his discourses. But such was
the taste of the times, when classic literature and art
were deluging Europe, and producing a revulsion in all
the laws of taste which had regulated the mediævals.
This affectation of classic learning was the bane of
Deza’s oratory, and it is constantly obtruding itself
on the reader, in a marked and offensive manner,
though nowhere perhaps so prominently as in his
sermon at the marriage of the Queen of Poland with
the Duke of Lorraine, in the Cathedral of Neustadt in
Austria, in which sermon, for instance, he enumerates
celebrated marriages, as those of Cadmus and Harmonia,
Jupiter and Juno, David and Michal, Isaac and Rebecca,
and that at Cana—all in one breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as his fame was established, he was in
request throughout his native land, and we find him
preaching at Bonona, Turin, and Milan. In 1664
he preached before the Doge at Genoa; in 1666 he
was in Malta. We have sermons of his delivered at
Rome in 1672, and at Venice in 1686. There is extant
a sermon by Deza on the birth of the Prince
of Wales, the so-called “Pretender,” son of James II.,
and an oration preached at Venice on the occasion of
the exhibition of the Blessed Sacrament for obtaining
success against the Turks, with whom the Republic
was then at war. Maximilian Deza was sent for
by Leopold I. to preach before him at Vienna, and
there the old man died peacefully in his seventy-seventh
year, <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1687.</p>

<p>His sermons were published in Italian, “Prediche
dell’ Avvento del P. Massimiliano Deza, Lucchese
della Congregatione della Madre di Dio,” by Nicolo
Pezzana, Venice, 1709.</p>

<p>There is also a Latin edition, translated by Cassimir
Moll, a Benedictine, published by Veith, Vienna, 1726,
and dedicated to John Julius de Moll, Archbishop of
Salzburg.</p>

<p>The sermons extant form three series; the first
consists of sermons from the First Sunday in Advent
to the Sunday after Christmas, together with two
discourses on the parable of the Prodigal Son, in
all nine, forming one volume. The second contains
thirty-eight sermons preached during Lent;
and the third part, which is immeasurably inferior
to the other two, consists of orations on divers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
saints, such as St. Catharine of Bologna, St. Peter of
Alcantara, St. Rosa of Lima, together with sermons
on state occasions.</p>

<p>Maximilian Deza just escaped being a really great
orator, like Segneri, whom he much resembles in his
vehemence, zeal, fine word-painting, and brilliant
transitions. There is nothing heavy or dull about his
sermons; they are calculated to rivet the attention of
an audience, and they appeal earnestly to the conscience.
They are not sermons to be read in measured
tones from the pulpit, but to be declaimed with flashing
eye, modulated voice, and vehement gesture. To modern
readers Deza seems to play with an idea in a manner
unsuitable to our nineteenth century ideas of pulpit
proprieties; but it must be borne in mind that his
discourses are long, lasting sometimes two hours, and
the mind of the hearer would need rest, it would only
be fatigued if kept constantly on the stretch. Viewed
thus, it will be seen that Deza handles his matter with
great skill; he works one point of his subject to a climax,—you
hold your breath even in reading him—and then
he gently drops the point, and gives time for relaxation
of the attention till he deems it fit to produce another
effect, just as in a drama the sensational scenes are
separated from each other by the talkee-talkee scenes
in the front groove. But these intermediate portions of
Deza’s sermons are by no means dull; they are light
and pleasant trifles with which he toys, but which lead
on insensibly to his point, just as the small beads of a
rosary draw the fingers on to the larger ones.</p>

<p>Take his sermon for Ash-Wednesday as an example.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
He is preaching on the words, “Remember, O man,
that thou art dust, and that into dust thou shalt
return,” which occur in the Roman Office for the
day.</p>

<p>He begins with the lessons drawn from the ashes
sprinkled every where; and he bids his hearers look
on these ashes, and remember that they shall one day
be like them. He then draws with skill a picture of
man’s forlorn condition, with the prospect of death
before him, and no possibility afforded him of escape.
He laughs to scorn the thoughts of immortality connected
with name and title; he tells the story of
Empedocles seeking an immortal name by jumping
into the crater of Ætna; and then he warns his
hearers most solemnly to keep death ever before their
eyes. Remember, he cries, that you have sucked in
with your mother’s milk the seeds of death. Remember
that all beasts were created alive, but Adam
was created a lifeless frame, till God breathed into his
nostrils the breath of life. Remember that from the
moment of birth, the moment of death began to creep
nearer. Then suddenly pointing to the hour-glass he
exclaims, Look! this hour is stealing away in grains of
dust, warning you to remember what you too ere long
will become. And having worked this out with great
solemnity, he suddenly breaks off into a description of
glass and its manufacture. He says it is made of sand
and ash, it is fused with heat, it is formed by the breath.</p>

<p>Is not that like man? he asks; man made of dust,
kindled by the glow of life, vivified by the Divine
breath?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>Well! you will say that glass is a very brittle affair;
it somewhat resembles ice, and is just as fragile; one
little fall, and it is shivered into countless fragments;
it is made by a puff, it is clouded by a breath, it is
broken by a touch.</p>

<p>You consider it very fragile.—I tell you, on the
authority of St. Augustine, that man is far more fragile.</p>

<p>Glass carefully preserved may become an heirloom,
but man can never last out more than a generation.</p>

<p>Glass is only shattered by accident, but man is
perishable by his nature.</p>

<p>Glass is broken by external force, but man bears
about within him the seeds of dissolution.</p>

<p>Glass is snapped by a touch, but man untouched will
crumble into his grave.</p>

<p>Glass once broken may be restored, not so man.</p>

<p>Glass though broken does not decay, but man’s flesh
becomes corrupt.</p>

<p>Having thus amused and rested his hearers, Deza
begins another earnest appeal to them; he explains
that the soul of man does not descend to the grave,
and he solves a difficulty in the text, Genesis iii. 19,
<i>Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return</i>.</p>

<p>Having done this, it is proper that the congregation
should be given a little breathing-time, and so the
preacher takes the sentence, <i>Dust thou art</i>, and plays
with it, by giving a description of dust agitated by the
wind. Oh, into what fantastic shapes does the wind
whirl the dust! how the dust-cloud runs along, rushes
forward madly, stops and spins awhile, and tosses itself
up, up, till it seems verily to fly; it ascends higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
and higher, it is carried above the tree-tops, it will
reach the clouds of Heaven. Stay!—the wind drops.
Where is the dust? It falls, it obscures the landscape,
it is scattered every where, it parches the tongue, it
blinds the eyes, it clogs the throat; and that which
just now dulled the air and obscured the sun, has
returned to itself again; dust it was, and nothing more,
and unto dust has it returned.</p>

<p>Is not this a picture of man? asks the preacher;
man, poor dust carried up and hurried forward by
the winds of his vain fancies? Ambition puffs him up
on high, only to fling him to earth again; passion
drives him forward, and then drops him a helpless
atom to his native soil.</p>

<p>Look how high those giddy particles are flung—<i>Thou
takest away their breath, they die, and are turned
again to their dust</i>.</p>

<p>Yes, toss yourselves in pride, rush on in the storm of
passion, eddy up in the struggle of life, spin in the
giddiness of pleasure, penetrate every where in the
eagerness of curiosity—<i>Thou takest away their breath,
they die, and are turned again to their dust</i>.</p>

<p>Deza then examines the words of Solomon, <i>There is
a time to be born and a time to die</i>, and he asks why
the King did not say there is a time to live. Having
answered this question to his own satisfaction, by showing
that Solomon spoke of definite moments of time,
but that life was not a point of time, but a fleeting
succession of moments, he enters on the subject of the
shortness of time, and quotes Wisdom v. 10. The life
of man, says Solomon, is <i>as a ship that passeth over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
waves of the water</i>, and leaves no trace—no trace but the
foam-bubbles; and those foam-bubbles are like the life
of man, now appearing in the wake of the vessel, and
then brushed away by the next wave,—and this wave
is like the life of man, sweeping on resistlessly to the
rock on which it will be shivered with a roar—a roar
like the life of man, loud and fierce for the moment,
and then carried off on the wind—the wind like the
life of man sinking into a lull and lost.</p>

<p>And so throughout the sermon.</p>

<p>I will now give an analysis of one of Maximilian Deza’s
most characteristic and striking discourses, with a translation
of a portion of it as a specimen of his style of
oratory.</p>

<p>The sermon I have selected is that for the First
Sunday in Advent, with which the Feast of St. Andrew
coincided. The lessons from each holiday are very
happily blended.</p>

<p>Maximilian Deza takes two texts, the first from the
twenty-first chapter of St. Luke, <i>Then shall they see
the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and
great glory</i>; and the second from the Office for St.
Andrew’s Day, “Blessed Andrew prayed, saying,
Hail, good Cross! may He receive me by thee, Who
by thee redeemed me.”</p>

<p>Introduction.</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>On this coincidence of holidays two points of consideration
are presented to us; the Cross the
sign of terror and destruction to the guilty,
and the Cross the sign of joy and salvation to
the just.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>I. The love of the Cross is the characteristic of the
elect; whilst the hatred of the Cross is the
sign of the reprobate.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>α. The Lord knoweth those that are His—by
their love of His Cross of suffering.
<i>If any man will come after Me, let him
deny himself, and take up his cross, and
follow Me.</i></p>

<p>β. But the wicked are called <i>the enemies of
the Cross of Christ, whose end is destruction</i>.</p>

</div>

<p class="not">The day will come, the great and terrible
day of the Lord, when He will call the
heavens from above, and the earth, that He
may judge His people; when the Cross,
the sign of the Son of Man, will appear in
the clouds of Heaven.</p>

<p>II. Then God will judge the world with fire, and
the Cross alone will be the standard by which
all will be tried.</p>

<p class="not">God will judge the world with fire.—How
with fire? When a palace is destroyed by the
flames, every thing in it is reduced to cinder;
the rags of the beggar, the gorgeous robes of
the prince, the statue of the king, and the
image of the ape. So every man will be tried
with fire, and all difference between man and
man as now existing will be rendered indistinguishable.
King and subject, master and
slave, will stand shivering in nakedness beside
each other; there is no respect of persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
with God, they will be but as a heap
of cinders, which are equally hideous, though
some may be the ashes of costly articles,
others of vile materials.</p>

<p class="not">One alone distinguishing mark will be
left, the love of the Cross, by which to judge
them.</p>

<p>III. By the Cross will the saints be recognized, as
in Ezekiel ix. the prophet saw in vision the
destruction of the last day, when God’s command
was, <i>Slay utterly old and young, both
maids, and little children, and women: but come
not near any man upon whom is the mark
Tau</i>.</p>

<p class="not">This Tau, Deza observes, is the Cross, the
mark on the brow by which the faithful shall
be known. Tau is the last letter of the Hebrew
alphabet, and it is the last sign which shall
appear in Heaven. The preacher then goes
through the list of those slain, old and young,
maids, and little children, and women, and
shows how that wisdom of grey hairs, or innocency
of childhood, or purity of virgins, are of
no avail to stand the fire of trial unless the
Cross be the source of those graces.</p>

<p class="not">The Cross is the banner of the King in His
army on earth. It is the tree of life in the
Paradise of His Church.</p>

<p>IV. The Cross, as sign of safety to some and of
destruction to others, was prefigured in the
Old Testament—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>α. By the rod of Moses, which opened the sea
for the passage of the Israelites, and
which brought it back again to overwhelm
the Egyptians.</p>

<p>β. By the ark of Noah.</p>

<p>γ. By the blood-marks on the lintel and door-post
when the destroying angel passed
through Egypt.</p>

</div>

<p>V. A contrast is drawn between St. Peter and the
penitent thief. The former feared the Cross,
and when our Lord spoke of His approaching
crucifixion, the Apostle said, <i>Be it far from
Thee</i>; and was therefore suffered to fall. But
the thief who sought Christ through the Cross
found acceptance.</p>

<p>VI. Deza shows that people may now become
enemies of the Cross of Christ—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>α. By gluttony and drunkenness.</p>

<p>β. By debauchery and frivolity.</p>

<p>γ. By injustice and dishonesty.</p>

<p>δ. By falsehood and calumnies.</p>

<p>ε. By hypocrisy.</p>

</div>

<p class="not">He draws a very solemn and awful picture of
the dawning of the great day, and the flashing
of the sign of the Son of Man upon the enemies
of the Cross of Christ, and then—</p>

<p>VII. He comments on the sentences pronounced
on the good and on the bad. This is the passage
I translate.</p>

</div>

<p>Part II.</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>VIII. Maximilian Deza now shows how St. Andrew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
is a blessed child of the Cross. He
shows how that to him the Cross was as a
second mother, guiding him through life, sustaining
him and embracing him in death.</p>

<p>IX. The love of Christ’s Cross regenerates us, assures
us of our sonship, and is an earnest of
our inheritance.</p>

<p class="not">At our birth into this world we are placed
in divers positions by the will of God and by
no appointment of our own. So some are
born to be kings, some to be slaves, some to
be philosophers, others to be fools.</p>

<p class="not">But at the regeneration it will not be so.
Our position then will be regulated by our
own selves, for we shall be nearer to, or more
remote from, Christ; be princes or subjects
according to our love for the Cross of Christ
during our earthly existence, according to the
closeness of our walk in the bloody footprints
of our Master, bearing our crosses after
Him, in the season of our probation.</p>

</div>

<p>And in conclusion, Deza makes an eloquent and
earnest appeal to his hearers to <i>redeem the time because
the days are evil</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following is a translation of the seventh section
of this most striking sermon, which exhibits at the
same time his power and his weakness, his merits and
his defects:—</p>

<p>“Behold!” will say the Judge, with threatening voice,
to that great throng of accused; “behold! on this Cross<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
I poured forth all the treasures of My love—producing
blood for your welfare; to you though was that most
precious stream counted but as dung, squandered recklessly
for some fleeting vanity. From this My Cross
with last and dying voice, with tears breathing nought
but piety, I called you to penitence, but as deaf adders
you stopped your ears and hardened your hearts to the
sweet incantations of love. On this Cross, full of sorrows
and of confusion, painfully I suffered death, that
I might recover eternal life for your souls; and you,
meanwhile, before the countenance of God dying for
you, did laugh with the scribes, mock with the Pharisees,
sport with the soldiers. This My Cross was a
noble pulpit from which I, the Master of humility, of
patience, and of charity, taught you the love of your
enemies, praying to the Father for My foes and My
persecutors. But you! what did you take in, what did
you learn? Answer, what? The implacable madness
and rage of a Saul, the boastings of a Goliath, the impieties,
and crimes, and vengeance of a Cain, a Joab, or
an Absalom. And what! were your hopes too rash to
calculate on finding safety in that Cross? Ah, wretched
ones! Are ye not those to whom the withering roses
of this world were more acceptable than My thorns?
Are ye not those who sucked in the sweet poison from
the cup of Babylon, but rejected the chalice of My
passion? Are ye not those who, fleeing the embrace
of My Cross, rushed into the arms of lust which polluted
you, of the world which betrayed you, of Satan who
erects his trophies upon your ruin? These, these were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
your lovers, these the idols of your heart, these the
deities ye idolatrously worshipped—commend yourselves
now to them, let them arise and help you. In Me
remains no hope for you, no more bowels of mercies,—Depart
from Me, ye cursed! This Cross is your
condemnation; this gallows-tree is your scourge, this
wood will rack and consume you more fiercely than the
flames of hell. Depart from Me, ye cursed, into everlasting
fire.”</p>

<p>But oh, happy elect! to whom on the contrary the
holy Cross has been the bow of peace eternal, the ladder
of Heaven, the pledge of glory, the unfading palm of
lasting triumph. “Come, ye blessed of My Father!”
Oh, sweet words! best-loved invitation! most pleasant
reception, long-looked-for glimpse of Paradise so
near! “Come, ye blessed of My Father. Ye innocents
by your sweat, ye penitents by your tears, ye
martyrs by your blood, did water the tree of My Cross;
come now, gather the fruits of safety, life, and happy
immortality. Come, ye blessed of My Father. Ye who
followed My blood-stained traces up the hill of Calvary,
even ye shall ascend with Me to the topmost height
of the heavenly Sion, where this Cross is exalted to be
the trophy of your victories. Come, inherit the kingdom
prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
By nature were ye My subjects, but by grace My sons;
and as sons of a reigning Father My kingdom shall be
your patrimony, and My Cross the sceptre of a deathless
realm. My charity bore it, out of love for you;
your gratitude bore it, out of love for Me; now has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
come the season for both Me and you, that to patient
love should succeed love beatifying. As long as I am
God, that is, for eternity, ye shall also be happy, shall
be likewise glorious, triumphant, princes of Heaven with
starred diadem on your brows, and monarchs of the
universe.”</p>

<h2 id="FRANCIS_COSTER">FRANCIS COSTER.</h2>

<p>The subject of this memoir was born at Malines in the
year 1531; he was one of the first to join the new
Society of Jesus, and at the age of twenty-one was
received into it by the illustrious founder himself.</p>

<p>St. Ignatius soon discovered the remarkable talents
and the deep spirituality of the young man, and he
stationed him at Cologne, placing him in the van of the
army of the Church, and in the thick of the fight then
waging between Catholics and Protestants. He was
admirably adapted for his position, and fully justified the
confidence placed in him by Loyola. The Lutherans
and Calvinists found in him an enemy of no ordinary
power, and quite invulnerable to their blows. His knowledge
of Scripture was as thorough as, and was sounder
than, their own. Their arguments were dissected, and
the fallacies exposed, by Coster, in a manner so clear
and so conclusive that he stung them to madness.</p>

<p>Volume after volume passed through the press from
his pen, many of them composed in the vernacular, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
as to be read by the vulgar. He is said to have brought
back multitudes to the Church who had fallen away
at the first blush of Protestantism, and to have
strengthened numerous souls which wavered in doubt.</p>

<p>He taught astronomy and lectured on the Holy
Scriptures in Cologne. He was afterwards Rector of
several Colleges, thrice Provincial, and present at three
General Congregations of the Order.</p>

<p>After a life of controversy, yet with a soul full of
peace and goodwill to men, Francis Coster entered into
his rest in 1619, aged eighty-eight years; of which he
had spent sixty-seven in the Society of Jesus. He died
at Brussels.</p>

<p>His works are too numerous for me to give a list of
them here. A complete catalogue will be found in the
<i>Bibliothèque des Écrivains de la Compagnée de Jésus, par
Aug. et Alois Backer</i>, vol. i. pp. 218-224. I mention

<p>Francis Coster differs in style from all the other
preachers whom I have quoted. He is neither eloquent
nor impressive as a speaker, he is immensely long, and
must have been desperately tedious in the pulpit; and
yet I question whether a priest could possess a more
valuable promptuarium for sermon composition or catechetical
lecture than Coster’s volumes. Coster is rather
an expositor of Scripture than a preacher; his insight
into the significance of the sacred utterances is perfectly
marvellous.</p>

<p>Coster relates numerous stories of different merit and
point. He seldom indulges in simile. He says sharp
and <i>piquant</i> things in a quiet unassuming manner;
and unless the reader is quite on the alert, he may miss
some very happy remark couched in a few pregnant
words. For instance: he says on the subject of
Profession not Practice, that Christ lived thirty-three
years on earth, and He did many great works; but we
know of only one sermon that He preached. The arms
are long, the tongue is short; the hands are free, the
tongue confined behind the prison bars of the teeth; to
teach us that we should work freely, but talk little.
Those who profess great things and practise little what
they profess are in a bad spiritual condition; the clock
whose hand stands at one whilst the clapper goes twelve,
is wrong in the works.</p>

<p>The stories Coster tells are very unequal. There is
one delightful mediæval tale reproduced by him which
I shall venture to relate, as it is full of beauty, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
inculcates a wholesome lesson. There is a ballad in
German on the subject, to be found in Pocci and Göres’
<i>Fest Kalender</i>, which has been translated into English
and published in some Roman children’s books.</p>

<p>The story was, I believe, originated by Anthony of
Sienna, who relates it in his Chronicle of the Dominican
Order; and it was from him that the preachers and
writers of the Middle Ages drew the incident. With the
reader’s permission I will tell the story in my own words,
instead of giving the stiff and dry record found in Coster.</p>

<p>There was once a good priest who served a church in
Lusitania; and he had two pupils, little boys, who came
to him daily to learn their letters, and to be instructed
in the Latin tongue.</p>

<p>Now these children were wont to come early from
home, and to assist at mass, before ever they ate their
breakfast or said their lessons. And thus was each day
sanctified to them, and each day saw them grow in
grace and in favour with God and man.</p>

<p>These little ones were taught to serve at the Holy
Sacrifice, and they performed their parts with care and
reverence. They knelt and responded, they raised the
priest’s chasuble and kissed its hem, they rang the
bell at the sanctus and the elevation; and all they did,
they did right well.</p>

<p>And when mass was over, they extinguished the altar
lights, and then taking their little loaf and can of milk,
retired to a side chapel for their breakfast.</p>

<p>One day the elder lad said to his master—</p>

<p>“Good father, who is the strange child who visits us
every morning when we break our fast?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>“I know not,” answered the priest. And when the
children asked the same question day by day, the old
man wondered, and said, “Of what sort is he?”</p>

<p>“He is dressed in a white robe without seam, and it
reacheth from his neck to his feet.”</p>

<p>“Whence cometh he?”</p>

<p>“He steppeth down to us, suddenly, as it were from
the altar. And we ask him to share our food with us:
and that he doth right willingly every morning.”</p>

<p>Then the priest wondered yet more, and he asked,
“Are there marks by which I should know him, were
I to see him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, father; he hath wounds in his hands and
feet; and as we give him of our food, the blood flows
forth and moistens the bread in his hands, till it blushes
like a rose.”</p>

<p>And when the master heard this, a great awe fell
upon him, and he was silent awhile. But at last he
said gravely, “Oh, my sons, know that the Holy Child
Jesus hath been with you. Now when He cometh again,
say to Him, ‘Thou, O Lord, hast breakfasted with us full
often, grant that we brothers and our dear master may
sup with Thee.’”</p>

<p>And the children did as the priest bade them. The
Child Jesus smiled sweetly, as they made the request,
and replied, “Be it so; on Thursday next, the day of
My ascension, ye shall sup with Me.”</p>

<p>So when Ascension Day arrived, the little ones came
very early as usual, but they brought not their loaf, nor
the tin of milk. And they assisted at mass as usual;
they vested the priest, they lighted the tapers, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
chanted the responds, they rang the bell. But when
the Pax vobiscum had been said they remained on their
knees, kneeling behind the priest. And so they gently
fell asleep in Christ, and they with their dear master
sat down at the marriage supper of the Lamb.</p>

<p>This story reminds me of another, to be found in one
or two mediæval sermons.</p>

<p>A little boy once made an agreement with an aged
priest that they should say Prime together.</p>

<p>So, on the first morning after the arrangement, the
child rose, and descended to the church, where he lighted
the candles. He waited long for the priest, and pulled
the bell; but the old man turned in his bed and would
not rise. Then the lad looked from the window, and
the land was dumb with snow. He thought, I will
run forth, and sport in the snow, for the father comes
not to Prime. But he resisted the temptation, and he
recited the office by himself in choir.</p>

<p>On the second morning he descended again, and rang
the bell, and lighted the tapers; but the priest came
not. Then the boy thought, I will go forth and slide
on the frozen pond. But he overcame the temptation,
and recited the office by himself in choir.</p>

<p>On the third morning he turned in his bed, and
thought, It is so cold, I will not rise; the father will
not leave his bed, nor will I. But he resisted the
temptation to lie in bed, he dressed and came down to
the church, he pulled the bell, he lighted the tapers;
but the priest came not, so he sang the office by himself
in choir.</p>

<p>And this continued for six mornings; each morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
was the child tempted, each morning did he overcome
the temptation. Each morning the priest lay in bed,
and the little boy sang the office by himself in choir.</p>

<p>On the seventh morning the priest was roused by the
bell, but he turned in bed and fell asleep again. Then
he had a dream. He beheld in his dream the Lord
Jesus standing by the treasury in Heaven; and in His
hand He bare seven crowns of pure gold. “Oh, my
Lord, are these for me?” exclaimed the sleeper.
“Nay!” replied the Blessed One, “not for thee, but
for thy little acolyte. Seven times has he been tried,
and seven times has he overcome; therefore have I prepared
for him seven crowns. <i>Blessed is the man that
endureth temptation, for when he is tried he shall receive
the crown of life.</i>”</p>

<p>But leaving these stories, let us turn to a sermon of
Coster’s, and analyze it thoroughly. It will be seen how
pregnant it is with thought, how exhaustive it is as a
commentary on a passage of Scripture, how suggestive
it is of matter for a modern preacher.</p>

<p>I shall choose the sermon for the First Sunday in
Lent, curtailing it in only a few points, where the
conclusions drawn seem unwarranted, or where the
doctrine enforced is distinctively Roman. These
omissions I have made from no wish to misrepresent
the preacher, but simply to reduce the bare skeleton
of the sermon to moderate limits, the entire discourse
filling forty-seven pages of quarto, close print,
double columns, and occupying about 5000 lines. I
tremble to think of the time it must have taken to
deliver, if it ever were delivered.</p>

<p class="center sermon">First Sunday in Lent. Lessons from the Gospel.</p>

<p class="center">Matt. iv. <i>And Jesus was led by the Spirit into the
wilderness.</i></p>

<p>He was <i>led</i>. Here note—</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>1. That God is our leader into all good works.</p>

<p>2. That He leads, but does not constrain.</p>

</div>

<p><i>By the Spirit.</i> Here note—</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>1. That in our Lent fast, we should follow the
Spirit’s leading. Now the Spirit leads and
guides—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>α. By the voice of the Church.</p>

<p>β. By the voice of conscience.</p>

</div>

<p>2. That our works are alone acceptable to God, if
done through the grace and impulsion of the
Spirit.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Into the wilderness.</i> Here note—</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>1. That Christ went into the wilderness to make
expiation in His body for our excesses; to
endure poverty for our luxury, want for our
abundance.</p>

<p>2. That Christ went into the wilderness immediately after baptism, to teach us that, by
baptism, we are called to renounce the world,
and to lead a life of mortification.</p>

<p>3. That Christ sets us an example of retirement
from the world and its turmoil, at seasons.</p>

<p>4. That Christ, by His example, has sanctioned
and sanctified the life of the eremite.</p>

</div>

<p><i>To be tempted of the devil.</i> Here note—</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>1. That, in order to be able to resist the devil, we
must be furnished with the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>2. That God suffers us to be tempted for wise
purposes—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>α. To bring out our hidden virtues; thus He
brought out the virtue of faith in Abraham
by tempting him to slay his son, and the
virtue of patience in Job by suffering him
to be afflicted with loss of substance, health,
and friends.</p>

<p>β. To keep us vigilant. (1 Pet. v. 8.)</p>

<p>γ. To reward us finally for our merit in resisting
temptation. (James i. 12.)</p>

</div>

<p>3. A. The word ‘to tempt’ has three significations
in Holy Scripture. It signifies—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>α. To bring out hidden graces; and thus is
used of God tempting us. (Gen. xxii. 1.)</p>

<p>β. To lead into sin; and thus is used of the
devil tempting us. (1 Cor. vii. 5.)</p>

<p>γ. To provoke to anger; and thus is used of
our tempting God. (Ps. xcv. 9. Acts
v. 9. Heb. i. 12.)</p>

</div>

<p>B. God tempts us in Lent, drawing out of us
a proof—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>α. Whether we love ourselves better than
Him.</p>

<p>β. Whether we love our souls better than our
bodies.</p>

<p>γ. Whether we love our present corruptible
bodies better than our future incorruptible
bodies.</p>

<p>δ. Whether we love to obey the Church better
than to follow our own wills.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>4. Christ endured temptation from the devil—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>α. That He might prove the force of every
temptation by which we are assailed.</p>

<p>β. That He might show us how to meet
temptation.</p>

<p>γ. That He might break the force of temptation.</p>

<p>δ. That He might teach us to expect temptation.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p><i>And when He had fasted forty days and forty nights.</i></p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>Note that Christ fasted, though there was no need
for Him to mortify His body, in that His
body was free from sin.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Forty days and forty nights.</i> Here note—</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>1. That forty represents the law as amplified by
the Gospel, 10 × 4.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>α. Forty days did the rain descend to flood
the world. (Gen. vii. 4.)</p>

<p>β. Forty days were corpses dressed with
aromatic herbs before consigning them
to the grave. (Gen. l. 3.)</p>

<p>γ. Forty years did Israel wander in the
wilderness.</p>

<p>δ. Forty days did Moses spend, on two occasions,
in the mount. (Exod. xxiv. 18;
xxxiv. 28.)</p>

<p>ε. Forty days did Goliath defy the armies
of the living God. (1 Sam. xvii. 16.)</p>

<p>ζ. Forty days did Ezekiel bear the iniquities
of the children of Israel. (Ezek.
iv. 6.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>η. Forty days did Elijah fast in the desert.
(1 Kings xix. 8.)</p>

<p>θ. Forty days did Nineveh afflict itself in
sackcloth and ashes. (Jonah iii. 4.)</p>

<p>ι. Forty days was Christ with His Apostles
after the resurrection. (Acts i. 3.)</p>

</div>

<p>2. We keep forty days of Lenten fast—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>α. That we may represent in the Christian
year the fasting of our Lord, as we also
represent His birth, His death, His
resurrection, and His ascension.</p>

<p>β. That we may appease God’s wrath against
us; making satisfaction to the best of our
power for our fallings short during the
rest of the year.</p>

<p>γ. That we may practise and test our strength,
so as to be able to exert it when temptation
arises.</p>

<p>δ. That we may fulfil Christ’s words, <i>When
the Bridegroom is taken away, then shall ye
fast in those days</i>.</p>

<p>ε. That we may worthily prepare for the
great solemnity of Easter, suffering with
Christ that we may also be glorified
together.</p>

</div>

<p>3. The advantages of fasting are,—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>α. It keeps the body under, and brings it
into subjection; giving us the habit of
obtaining a mastery over our appetites.</p>

<p>β. It disposes the soul for prayer, and the
mind for meditation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>γ. It makes reparation for past offences.
(Jonah iii. 5-10.)</p>

<p>δ. It is meritorious, being one of those three
works of which Christ has said that
it shall be openly rewarded. (Matt.
vi. 18.)</p>

</div>

</div>

<p><i>And when the tempter came to Him, he said.</i> Here
note—</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>I.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>α. The devil is called tempter, as one who
builds is called a builder, and one who
paints is called a painter: from the work
upon which he is constantly engaged.</p>

<p>β. The devil probably came in human form,
as angels when appearing to men assumed
human forms. It seems likely that Satan
had not fathomed that mystery, which
angels desired to look into, the mystery
of the Incarnation, and that he did not
know that Christ was Incarnate God:
yet was he filled with vague alarm.</p>

<p>γ. Christ’s temptations came from without;
they could not proceed from within, as
His nature was sinless.</p>

</div>

<p>II. We also learn—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. That solitude is not freedom from temptation,
but rather a time for it.</p>

<p>2. That Satan expends the whole force of
temptation on those who are leading a
life of high vocation.</p>

<p>3. That Satan suits his temptation to the
occasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>4. That if Christ endured temptation, no man
must expect to escape it.</p>

<p>5. That if Christ suffered Satan to approach
Him with temptation, He will not reject
us drawing nigh unto Him in
prayer.</p>

<p>6. That temptations come to us in disguise:
the evil one seldom presenting himself to
us in his naked deformity.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p><i>If Thou art the Son of God.</i> Here note—</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>Satan had heard the voice from Heaven, proclaiming
Christ to be the beloved Son of God; but he
may have considered Him as a son in some
sense as Adam, who was called a son of God.
That he could have grasped the mystery of
the hypostatic union is impossible. Sin produces
blindness, and Satan could not have seen
and comprehended God’s purposes. Had he
believed Christ to be very and eternal God, it
is inconceivable that he should have thought
it possible to tempt Him into sin, unless the
eyes of his understanding were so obscured
by his pride that he had lost belief in all
good, that he actually could imagine the Godhead
to be peccable, just as a prostitute disbelieves
in the purity of the most spotless
virgin.</p>

</div>

<p><i>If Thou art.</i> Note—</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>I. That Satan tempts even by that little word <i>if</i>;
implying a doubt whether God had meant
what He said when the voice came from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
Heaven; by this word <i>if</i> Satan endeavoured
to drive Him into—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>α. The sin of pride: by causing Him to
perform a miracle, so as to prove
Himself to be the Son of God, and
thus to dispel the doubt of the querist.</p>

<p>β. The sin of doubt: by causing Him to
question the declaration from Heaven;
for Satan’s <i>if</i> implied that God, had He
meant that Christ were His Son, would
not have left Him to starve.</p>

</div>

<p>II. That it does not behove us to question the
dealings of God’s providence, though He suffer
us to want, nor if He refuse to hear our
petitions. Perhaps we ask for what is wrong,
unsafe, or contrary to His will.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Command that these stones be made bread.</i> Here note—</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>1. God wills to draw us from temporal things
to things spiritual, but the devil obtrudes
carnal matters, to draw us from spiritual
things to things temporal.</p>

<p>2. The temptation of Christ bears some analogy to
that of our first parents. Eve was tempted
by the sight of the fruit which was good
for food, Christ by the cravings of natural
hunger.</p>

<p>3. Satan tempts us through our need for the
necessaries of life. Thus some steal, others
cheat, others live unchaste lives, under the
excuse that they do it for a livelihood.</p>

<p>4. If Christ by a word can change stones into bread,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
can He not change bread into His true and
sacred Flesh?</p>

<p>5. Satan tempts Christ to make more than was
necessary, <i>these stones</i>, so that He might fall
into the sin of gluttony.</p>

<p>6. Satan tempts Christ to a false humility, by
urging Him to make bread, the plainest food
of the poor, instead of costly viands.</p>

<p>7. Satan never offers what can satisfy. The prodigal
son was given but the husks, and here
Satan presents nought but stones.</p>

<p>8. Christ left Satan still in doubt as to whether
He were the Son of God or not: teaching
us pious reserve on the subject of spiritual
favours.</p>

</div>

<p><i>And He answered and said, It is written, Man shall not
live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out
of the mouth of God.</i> Here note—</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>1. Christ implies that God’s power is not limited
to the means prescribed by Satan. God can
satisfy His own sons in ways of His own
devising.</p>

<p>2. Christ passes over the challenge, <i>If Thou art
the Son of God</i>, teaching us that our spiritual
privileges are not to be proclaimed, but rather
concealed, that pearls are not to be cast before
swine, nor the children’s bread to be given to
dogs.</p>

<p>3. Christ’s words imply the full inspiration of
Scripture: He says, that man shall live by
<i>every word</i>; not by the general sense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>4. Christ’s words are prophetic: they indicate the
fact that He Himself was to be the true food
of man, He being the Word of God, He to be
present as man’s spiritual food and sustenance
in the Blessed Sacrament of the Altar, until
the end of time.</p>

<p>5. Christ answered in the words of Scripture,
teaching us that in Scripture, as in an
armoury, are the weapons of our spiritual
warfare. The sword of the Spirit is the
Word of God.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Then the devil taketh Him up into the holy city, and
setteth Him on a pinnacle of the temple, and saith unto
Him.</i> Here note—</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>1. In the first temptation we have Satan coming
to our Blessed Lord as a man moved with
compassion for His famished condition. In
the second, he appears as an angel of light,
bearing Him to the holy city, as the angel
bore Habakkuk to Babylon, and the Spirit of
the Lord caught away Philip to Azotus. In
the third, he presents himself as a god demanding
worship.</p>

<p>2. Christ’s great love is noticeable here, in suffering
Himself to be borne hither and thither,
whithersoever the tempter listed. So did He
afterwards suffer Himself to be dragged by
the wicked Jews from the judgment hall to
Gabbatha and to Calvary. So too now does He
suffer His sacred body to be in the hands and
mouths of unworthy priests and lay communicants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
and to be offered in the meanest chapel,
and to be carried to the filthiest hovel of the
sick.</p>

<p>3. Temptation to spiritual pride is severe to those
who are leading a high spiritual life; temptation
to pride is common to all who are placed
in high positions, whether in Church or
State.</p>

<p>4. We must not be scandalized at the manner in
which Episcopal appointments are made,
whether by intrigue, or by State interference;
Christ was exalted to a pinnacle of the temple
by the devil, and many a holy man may be
elevated to the dignity of the Episcopacy by
the vilest of means.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Holy city</i>, so called because—</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>1. In it was the temple of God.</p>

<p>2. Christ was present in the city to sanctify it.</p>

<p>3. It was a shadow of the Heavenly Jerusalem.</p>

</div>

<p><i>If Thou be the Son of God, cast Thyself down.</i> Note—</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>This temptation followed the other as though deduced
from it. Satan implied, “You have done
well in showing your reliance on God; perfect
your reliance, prove how complete it is.” Observe
also that—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. Christ’s temptation is not only to spiritual
pride, but also to vain-glory, in that the
prospect was before Him of being seen by
men, supported by angelic hands, and thus
of establishing His position as a prophet, at
the outstart of His ministry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>2. Satan not only makes use of our natural wants,
but even of our virtues, as means of temptation;
urging us to carry them to excess.
But virtue consists in moderation, in neither
doing too much nor too little. Thus liberality
lies between avarice and prodigality, and
compunction is the mean betwixt assurance
and despair.</p>

<p>3. Satan has no power to cast us down without
the consent of our own free wills. He may
urge to fall, but he cannot compel man to
fall.</p>

<p>4. Satan endeavours to cast down to earth, whilst
Christ is ever striving to draw man from
earth, to lead man <i>to seek those things which are
above</i>. (Col. iii. 2.)</p>

<p>5. We are guilty of casting ourselves down from
the pinnacle upon which we are placed, whenever—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>α. We presumptuously neglect the natural
means of support with which God has
supplied us.</p>

<p>β. We deliberately fall into sin, with the
purpose of expiating it afterwards by
confession.</p>

<p>γ. We undertake any unprofitable task.
For a Christian should set before him
nothing upon which to expend his time
and energies but what is of utility.</p>

<p>δ. We do evil that good may come.</p>

</div>

</div>

</div>

<p><i>For it is written, He shall give His angels charge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
concerning Thee: and in their hands they shall bear Thee
up, lest at any time Thou dash Thy foot against a stone.</i></p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>I. Satan placed two dangers before our Lord: that
of being dashed to pieces, and that of committing
a sin.</p>

<p class="not">To remove the fear of either committing the
sin, or of exposing Himself to danger, Satan
quotes Scripture. He does this on two
grounds—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. To exhibit himself in a favourable light,
as though he were the angel of God
sent to bear Christ up.</p>

<p>2. To remove the fear of injury, on the
authority of Scripture promises.</p>

</div>

<p>II. Satan endeavours to remove the prospect of
danger, so as to make the thought of committing
the sin less alarming. For many are
deterred from crime by fear of its consequences;
and if the fear be removed, then
they are ready to commit the sin.</p>

<p class="not">Eve was prevented from disobeying God by
the fear of the consequences (Gen. iii. 3);
Satan removed the fear when he said, <i>Ye
shall not surely die</i>; and then at once the
woman fell. So when Satan removes the fear
of death, as something doleful to think upon,
when we are in health, we are ready enough
to sin. Whereas fear is salutary; as says
Scripture, <i>To fear the Lord is the beginning of
wisdom</i>. Ecclus. i. 14. 16. Matt. iii. 7. Luke
xii. 5. Examples of the fear of the Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
deterring from sin in Gen. xxxix. 9. Hist.
Susanna 23.</p>

<p>III. Satan quotes Scripture for his own vile purposes,
to screen himself under the semblance
of piety. We have a warning here against
those renegade Catholic priests and monks
who desert the Church and the authority of
the Bishops, that they may give themselves
up to heresy and to unclean living, sheltering
themselves all the while under Scripture texts
distorted to serve their own purposes.</p>

<p>IV. Satan garbles Scripture in quoting it.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. He distorts the sense. Christ needed not
angelic hands to sustain Him, and therefore
the passage is not applicable to Him,
but refers to His people. (Acts i. 9.
Heb. i. 3.)</p>

<p>2. He omits passages which did not suit his
purpose. The words are, <i>They shall keep
Thee in all Thy ways</i>, i. e. in the ways of
God’s commandments, not in breaking
those commands. He also omits, <i>Thou
shalt go upon the lion and adder: the young
lion and the dragon shalt Thou tread under
Thy feet</i>, because those words referred to
himself as overcome by Christ.</p>

</div>

<p>V. Note also how great is the dignity of the
true servant of God, upon whom, by God’s
command, the angels wait. Hence we may
learn:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. Not to regard ourselves as of no value, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
we are so highly esteemed of God that
He commissions His own ministers to
attend on us.</p>

<p>2. To entrust ourselves altogether to their
guidance, for they will keep us in perfect
peace.</p>

<p>3. To lead such a life as will make the angels
surround us, and be our constant attendants.
As bees swarm about a bed of
flowers, so will they gather around those
who bloom with Christian graces. Thus,
the Bride is spoken of as <i>terrible as an
army with banners</i>, that army of the living
God, the angelic hosts of <i>chariots and
horses of fire</i> surrounding the faithful.
Around the bed of Solomon were <i>threescore
valiant men</i>. And angels are about
our bed watching and protecting us.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p><i>Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy
God.</i> Note here that—</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>I. Christ does not enter into a long discussion with
the devil, but at once silences him, knowing
his obduracy. (Tit. iii. 10.) He teaches us
thereby not to parley with diabolic suggestions,
but at once to suppress them.</p>

<p>II. Christ answered in the words of Scripture, to
show us how to meet the assaults of the evil
one; not with weapons of our own devising,
but with those taken from the armoury of
God’s Word.</p>

<p>III. Christ met and overcame Satan with his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
weapon. Thus did David slay Goliath with
his own sword; thus was Haman hanged on
his own gallows; thus did Christ triumph at
the last over Satan by a tree, wherewith
Satan had ruined man.</p>

<p>IV. We tempt the Lord our God, whenever—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. Presumptuously we require Him to alter
the course of nature on our behalf.</p>

<p>2. We rush needlessly into danger.</p>

<p>3. We thoughtlessly cast ourselves into prayer,
without having prepared our minds as to
what we shall ask. (Eccles. xviii. 23.)</p>

<p>4. We persevere in sin that grace may abound,
postponing repentance, stopping our ears
to the calls of God.</p>

<p>5. We tie God down to means, as the princes
of Bethulia tempted God, when they said
that they would give up the city in five
days. (Judith viii. 11.)</p>

<p>6. We attempt to excogitate the meaning of
Scripture, with regard to doctrine, for
ourselves, without following the direction
of our divinely-constituted and infallible
guide, the Church.</p>

<p>7. We stifle the promptings of conscience.</p>

<p>8. We neglect the appointed means of grace
for those of our own choosing.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p><i>Again the devil taketh Him up into an exceeding high
mountain, and showeth Him all the kingdoms of the world,
and the glory of them</i>; and St. Luke adds, <i>in a moment
of time</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>I. Whereas St. John was shown the kingdoms of
the world become the kingdom of the Lord
and of His Christ, in ecstatic vision, here in
vision are the kingdoms of the world shown
to Christ as bowing under the rule of Satan.</p>

<p>II. Note also, how that—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. Satan exhibited all the kingdoms to tempt
Christ, whilst to tempt us one jug of
wine, one fair woman, one handful of
gold, are deemed quite sufficient.</p>

<p>2. Satan showed the <i>glory</i> of the kingdoms of
earth, but not their emptiness, their
troubles, their fleetingness.</p>

<p>3. Satan spreads the net of ambition before
those who are leading a life of high spirituality.
Thus the Apostles, who had forsaken
all for Christ, yet strove amongst
themselves as to which of them should be
the greatest. (Luke xxii. 24. 2 Kings
xxiv. 2.)</p>

<p>4. Satan showed the glories of earth, not of
Heaven, trying by this temptation also
to withdraw Christ’s mind from things
above to things below.</p>

<p>5. Satan did not show the real kingdoms, but
only a semblance of them. So he offers
us, not those things which will satisfy,
but things which have no substance.
(James iv. 14.)</p>

<p class="not">Whatsoever there is in this world of
glory, of beauty, of majesty, is but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
shadow of <i>good things to come</i>. Satan tries
to urge us to clasp the shadow, that we
may lose the substance.</p>

<p>6. Satan showed all <i>in a moment of time</i>; we
learn thereby—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>α. That his temptations come upon us with
great suddenness.</p>

<p>β. That the things he offers us are fleeting
and without stability. In this world
nothing is enduring. (1 Cor. vii. 35.)
If Satan gives us what we desire, he
removes it from us speedily. (Ps.
lxxvi. 5. Prov. xiii. 11.)</p>

</div>

</div>

</div>

<p><i>And saith unto Him, All these things will I give Thee,
if Thou wilt fall down and worship me.</i> Here note—</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>I. Satan no longer says, <i>If Thou be the Son of God</i>,
for he is now presenting himself as God, and
might therefore be supposed to know all
things.</p>

<p>II. Note here also, that—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. The devil’s motive in tempting man is still
his unconquered pride. Still does he
desire to be equal with God. But one of
the three things which God hateth is,
<i>a poor man that is proud</i> (Ecclus. xxv. 2);
and who is poorer than the devil, yet who
more proud?</p>

<p>2. All sin leads to the worship of Satan,
and the breach of the First Commandment.
For sin is a turning from the
obedience of God to the bondage of corruption,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
a leaving the kingdom of grace
for the slavery of sin, an electing of eternal
death in the realm of outer darkness in
place of resurrection to eternal life in the
kingdom of Christ. All sin leads to this,
for—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>α. Sin must inherit death and damnation.</p>

<p>β. Sins lead to infidelity. (Ps. xiv. 1. Prov.
xviii. 3.)</p>

<p>γ. They make gods of mammon or the belly.
(Tobit iii. 3. Phil. iii. 19. Eph. v. 5.)</p>

</div>

<p>3. Satan is like a merchant offering wares in
exchange for souls; like the king of
Sodom who said, <i>Give me the souls, and
take the goods to thyself</i>. (Gen. xiv. 21,
Vulg.) But <i>what shall it profit a man, if
he shall gain the whole world and lose his
own soul?</i></p>

<p>4. Satan tells here three lies.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>α. He claims the world and its kingdoms as
his own, whereas they belong to God.
<i>The whole world is Mine, and all that
therein is.</i></p>

<p>β. He says that he gives kingdoms to whom
he will (St. Luke); whereas God says,
<i>By Me kings reign</i>. (Prov. viii. 15.
Dan. ii. 21. John xii. 31.)</p>

<p>γ. He says that he has power to bestow
things, whereas he has no such power
whatever.</p>

</div>

<p>5. Satan tempts Christ to fall down: and so—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>α. His deceptions have all one object: the
accomplishment of our fall.</p>

<p>β. No man can worship Satan, without
falling first most grievously.</p>

</div>

<p>6. Satan begins with small temptations, and ends
with great ones; begins with a matter of bread,
and ends with an offer of kingdoms. This
teaches us not to despise small temptations;
they are the forerunners of greater ones,
the <i>little foxes</i> which spoil <i>the vines</i>. (Cant. ii.
15.) Give an inch, and Satan will take an ell.
St. Peter began his fall by mixing with bad
company about a fire; he ended by denying
his Master with oaths and curses.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p><i>Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan; for
it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and
Him only shalt thou serve.</i></p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>I. Hitherto Christ has answered with gentleness,
as the shafts of the devil were aimed simply
at Himself as man; but now that Satan casts
the arrow of blasphemy against God, He is
kindled with zeal: thereby teaching us to
bear our own injuries with meekness, but
to resent with the flame of indignation any
affront offered to the majesty of God. So
Christ endured patiently being called a gluttonous
man and a winebibber, but He was
fired with zeal when He saw His Father’s
house made a house of merchandise.</p>

<p>II. Christ said not, <i>Get thee behind Me, Satan</i>; but,
<i>Get thee hence, Satan</i>: for to Satan there was left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
no place for repentance, whilst to Peter, all
that was needed was a following of Jesus in
His humiliations and sufferings.</p>

<p>III. The weapons wielded by Christ in His temptation,
were, pure trust in God, the Word of God,
and hatred of the devil.</p>

<p>IV. It is of advantage that when we are tempted,
we should recognize the tempter through his
disguise. Temptation loses half its power
when it is recognized as a temptation.
When Christ showed Satan that He knew
him, at once Satan took to flight. (1 Cor.
xi. 14. 2 Cor. ii. 11. 1 John iii. 4.)</p>

<p>V. Christ made no allusion to Satan’s offer, but
passed at once to the condition, to show
us that we should not suffer his allurements
to find the smallest lodgment in our
minds.</p>

<p>VI. Christ made use of the words, <i>Thou shalt
worship the Lord thy God</i>, instead of <i>Thou
shalt fear the Lord thy God</i>, Deut. vi. 13,
from which He quoted, to show that in Him
we have passed from the bondage of fear to
the liberty of love, from the fear of servants
to the reverence of children, that we have
come to the <i>perfect love</i> of the New Covenant,
which <i>casteth out fear</i> of the Old Law.</p>

<p>VII. Christ teaches us that God demands <i>worship</i>
and bodily reverence, that reverence of falling
down on the knee which Satan asked for himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>VIII. Christ says not only, <i>Thou shalt worship the
Lord thy God</i>, but also, <i>Him only shalt thou
serve</i>: to teach us that bodily and spiritual
worship is insufficient, unless it is followed
by obedient service; that acts of devotion must
go hand in hand with observance of the commandments.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Then the devil leaveth Him, and behold angels came and
ministered unto Him.</i></p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p><i>Leaveth Him</i>, St. Luke adds, <i>for a season</i>; for Satan
returned to Him with provocations throughout
His life, and finally afflicted Him on the cross.
It was of his coming to Him then that Christ
spoke, when He said, <i>The Prince of this world
cometh, and hath nothing in Me</i>. (John xiv. 30.)
It was then on the cross that Christ endured the
last assaults of Satan: then, when He made that
offering of a sweet-smelling savour, which, <i>when
the evil spirit had smelled, he fled into the uttermost
parts of Egypt, and the angel bound him</i>. (Tobit
viii. 3.)</p>

<p>Note here likewise that—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The devil leaveth Christ: thus does he also leave
us, after having tempted us,—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>α. In the hopes of returning with seven other
spirits to take up a permanent abode in
man’s heart, if found empty of the love
of Jesus.</p>

<p>β. That he may plot some new form of
temptation; retiring to gather strength.
We must use this time of freedom for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
recruiting our forces and collecting additional
arms of defence.</p>

<p>γ. That he may throw us off our guard, luring
us into false security and spiritual sloth:—tempting
us by his very absence.</p>

</div>

</div>

</div>

<p><i>Angels came and ministered unto Him</i>, when the temptation
was ended. In like manner will angels minister
to us if we successfully resist.</p>

<p>Observe also that—</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>I. This brings great consolation to the religious,
who have pledged themselves to the angelic
life of poverty, chastity, and obedience.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. Christ overcame the temptation of the flesh
when He rejected the offered stones.</p>

<p>2. Christ overcame the temptation to disobedience
and self-glorification when He remained
on the pinnacle of the temple instead
of showing a form of <i>will-worship</i> and
<i>voluntary humility</i> by casting Himself down.
And so should religious occupy any position
to which their superior appoints them without
seeking to desert it.</p>

<p>3. Christ overcame the temptation to avarice
when He rejected the offered kingdoms of
the world: electing rather, poverty.</p>

</div>

<p>II. Angelic consolation follows retirement: the
angels ministered to Christ in the wilderness.
It follows victory over temptation: the angels
ministered to Christ when the temptation was
ended.</p>

<p>III. Conflict with Satan does not lead to conquest:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
Christ took no spoils by His triumph. It is
rather the victory of successful defence, of
having <i>lost</i> nothing in the struggle, not of
having gained aught.</p>

</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now I ask any candid person whether this is not a
marvellous sermon, abounding in thought, overflowing
with suggestions? Having read it, will he take up
Scott, or Matthew Henry, or D’Oyly and Mant, and see
what those luminaries have to say on the passage of
Scripture thus wrought out by the Jesuit preacher?</p>

<p>I have not the least doubt as to the opinion he will
form on the contrast.</p>

<p>We may truly say of the majority of Protestant commentators,
that—<i>Their minds are blinded: for until this
day remaineth the veil—upon their heart—in the reading of
the Old</i>, or New, <i>Testament</i>. This is more applicable,
of course, to foreign reformed theologians—if I may use
the term theologian of those who are ignorant of the
first principles of theology—than to our own divines.
The English Church has always studied the Fathers, and
has loved them; there is no great gulf fixed between
us and the Mediævals, as there is between the Church
and Protestant sectaries, and gleams of patristic light
are reflected in the pages of our great divines. But
there are commentators among us, such as Scott, who,
scorning the master-expositors of early and Mediæval
days, go to the study of God’s Word with the veil of
their self-sufficiency on their hearts, and become hopelessly
involved in heresy.</p>

<p>Scott affords us a melancholy example of a mistaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
vocation. A commentator on Holy Scripture should be
a man of profound theological learning, and of great
intellectual power. Scott, a most amiable and pious
clergyman, was neither a well-read man, nor were his
abilities at all above par. His voluminous Commentary
is accordingly, though overflowing with pious sentiment,
of small theological value.</p>

<p>Protestant clergy commenting on Scripture, amidst
the bustle of their ministerial avocations and their connubial
distractions, without referring to the great works
of early and Mediæval theologians, whose whole lives
were spent in prayer and Scriptural studies, stand the
chance of blundering as grossly as would a farm labourer
if he undertook to excogitate, for himself, a
system of astronomy, without reference to any treatises
on the science already existing, or qualifying himself
for the study, by a mastery of the rule of three, but
regarded with unmitigated contempt all the discoveries
made by those who have spent their lives in the
exclusive study of the stars, and rejected as useless all
the appliances of art invented to facilitate this investigation.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="not">The object of this work is to enable
the youngest boys to master the

older students with a Manual for

may be called its mechanical parts.
The Vocabularies have been much
extended, and greater uniformity of
reference has been secured. A few
rules have been omitted or simplified.
Every thing has been done
which the long experience of the
Editor, or the practice of his friends
in their own schools has shown to
be desirable.</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
